Our work began with attempting to undo an act of historical erasure. By recruiting students from multiple schools to work as research assistants, we led a class to uncover and preserve lost or forgotten copies of the The Wilmington Daily Record, the African-American newspaper destroyed at the onset of the 1898 Wilmington Massacre. Our students located multiple copies, transcribed, and digitized them. The voices that the mob sought to silence are readable today by anyone with an internet connection.

We also produce arts and cultural events, including original musical productions "When the Battleâ€™s Over" and "Lost Love Song," with Rhiannon Giddens, Regina Carter, Clyde Edgerton, Christa Faison, the Williston Alumni Choir, and others.

The work is multi-faceted and ongoing.
