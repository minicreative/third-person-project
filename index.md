header_text: Third Person Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit initiative, was founded
  in 2015 by&#8212;as The New Yorker described us&#8212;"a loose-knit band of writers,
  teachers, scholars, and local history buffs." From those vague beginnings, TPP has
  evolved into one of the most innovative, community-driven research initiatives in
  the South.
