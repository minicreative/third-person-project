header_text: Third Person Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit initiative, was founded
  in 2015 by&#8212;as The New Yorker described us&#8212;"a loose-knit band of writers,
  teachers, scholars, and local history buffs." From those vague beginnings, TPP has
  evolved into one of the most innovative, community-driven research initiatives in
  the South.

home_about_content: Our work began with attempting to undo an act of historical erasure.
  By recruiting students from multiple schools to work as research assistants, we
  led a class to uncover and preserve lost or forgotten copies of the The Wilmington
  Daily Record, the African-American newspaper destroyed at the onset of the 1898
  Wilmington Massacre. Our students located multiple copies, transcribed, and digitized
  them. The voices that the mob sought to silence are readable today by anyone with
  an internet connection.
