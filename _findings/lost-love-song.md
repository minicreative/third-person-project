**Lost Love Song**  
*The Music of Samuel Coleridge Taylor*  
July 22nd, 2019  
7:30 PM  

Rhiannon Giddens, Regina Carter, and John Jeremiah Sullivan unite for “Lost Love Song,” a musical search for a forgotten masterpiece by Samuel Coleridge Taylor that reaches back to the origins of the blues. Music scholars often dub Coleridge Taylor, a London-born musician whose father was African, “the first great black composer.” His finest work was inspired by the legendary Fisk Jubilee Singers, out of Fisk University in Nashville. Coleridge Taylor witnessed concerts they gave on a European fundraising tour in the 1890s, and their stirring performances of old “plantation melodies” gave him renewed artistic fuel for his compositions. Carrie Sadgwar, a Wilmington native, was the lead soprano for the Fisk choir during those years. Sadgwar’s “boy friend” and future husband was none other than Alex Manly, the editor of the *Daily Record*, the pioneering African-American newspaper destroyed by a white-supremacist mob in the violence of 1898. Much about Carrie’s own remarkable life and career remains unknown, and will be explored here tonight. Multiple lost stories and songs––forgotten to history or in some cases deliberately blotted out––will surface in the course of this unique event.

Francesco Turrisi left his native Italy in 1997 to study jazz piano and early music at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in the Netherlands. Labeled a “musical alchemist,” he has released seven critically acclaimed albums. Earlier this year, he and Rhiannon Giddens collaborated on *There Is No Other*, which was given a rare 5-star rating by the *Guardian*. 

Xavier Davis is an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, producer, and educator who, in addition to performing with other groups, leads the Xavier Davis Trio. He has performed on two Grammy-winning albums (*The Good Feeling* and *Bringin' It*), taught at Juilliard, directed the Harlem Boys Choir, and currently teaches Jazz Piano at Michigan State University.
