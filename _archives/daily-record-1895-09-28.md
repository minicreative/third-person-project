## NEW BERNE GLEANINGS.

**Interesting Notes Gathered by Our Hustling Correspondent.**

Mrs. and Rev. George F. Miller and Mrs. Emma Johnson left the city last week for Washington City where they will attend the P.E. Conference that convenes there this week.

Dr. John S. Long, preached a very interesting and instructive sermon at St. Cypian P.E. church Sunday evening. The Congregation felt themselves benefited for having come out to hear Dr. Long.

Miss Charlotte Rhone returned home Saturday from Hyde County where she has been teaching, accompanied by Mrs. Farrow of Hyde who is the guest of Miss Rhone.

Prof. H. L. Jones of Philadelphia, who is traveling in Eastern N.C. giving Streoptician exhibitions and Bible sceneries. Addressed St. Peters Sabbath School, Sunday, and will give several lectures while here. Prof. Jones exhibited on Tuesday, at Odd Fellows Hall, in behald [sic] of St. Peters Church. He also exhibited on Wednesday, at Rue Chapel. Prof. Jones uses a double magic lantern which makes two pictures at the same time, and his selections of scenery are very good. The different [indecipherable] appreciate exhibitions [indecipherable]ing their full attendance.

Mrs. Linia Smith formerly of New Bern who is now residing in Worster, Mass., has come home on a visit to her friends. She is the guest of Mrs. Cora Simmons.

Mr. C.E. Physic as returned from Babaro where he has been teaching.

The Hon. J.H. Williams was in the city last week, in the interest of the “State Republican.” He is an old war horse, has been tried in the fire, and says that today he is pure gold. In an interview with the “Messenger.” He did some straight talking, although they say his tongue is crooked, and that he winked at the Judge, and that the Judge winked at him. Great is Williamson.

At a meeting of T.B. Reed Republican Association, held Tuesday night, Sept. 17, speeches were delivered by several of the members condemning the Constitutional Convention of S.C. for attempting to disenfranchise the colored voters throughout the U.S. to adhere to the Republican Party, and vote the straight Republican ticket.

## Memorial.

By Mr. R.H. White.

In the bloom of life when all seemed fair, in the very center of activity, the hearts of her many friends were caused to ache at the departure by the cold hand of the monster death, of that fair and estimable young lady in person of Miss Carrie Blount.

Though she had not reached her first score, she attained those principles which made her renowned in the community of our city. She was a Christian young lady and a consistent member of Shiloh Baptist Church, and held laudable and responsible positions there. All admired her, and to form her acquaintance was to love her. Emblems of elocution were visible and her desire for extended intelligence was predominant. Carrie no more exists; and while we deplore our loss and deport her to beautiful Pine Forest to imbed her remains and imbellish [sic] her grave with flowers, symbolizing our esteem, we humbly submit to the will of God in His omnipotence, for with an ideal view we survey angles [sic] fecilitating [sic] her, and escorting her to that Eternal mansion prepared for the faithful.

To the heart-felt family, we sympathize with them in their sore bereavement, bear an equal portion of their inevitable burden and refer them to an all wise God who doeth all things well.

Monday night last, a bright, gay, happy company, representing largely the intelligence and refinement of the city, assembled at St. Stephen’s parsonage, in honor of Rev. Gregg’s birthday.

Music filled the air, merry peals of laughter floated on the breeze, smiles of youth and beauty mingled with smiles of age and wisdom were given without stint to all, and all were [indecipherable]aded that it was [ ] engaging in pleasantries [ ] an insisting voice, requested the ministers to take their wives as [ ] in to supper. This made things blue for the RECORD man as he was not a minister and had no wife, but, he got there just the same, as did everyone who went to that table. It was a grand sociable and rich feast. We wish for the popular pastor many a happy birthday. How old is he?

Don’t be so inquisitive.

## ROCKINGHAM NOTES.

We are very glad to have her in our town this week, Miss Laura Hill of Wilmington, which is the guest of Miss Earice Loue.

There was a grand entertainment Tuesday night for the benefit of raising money for Mt. Pisgah Zion Church which was quite a success. Everydody  [sic] seem [sic] to enjoy themselves.

Miss Sallie Lomax spent this week in our town. She was the guest of Mrs. W.D. Leak. 

There was an entertainment [indecipherable] at the residence of Mr. Jary Peak, Wednesday, for the pleasure of Misses Laura Hill and Sallie Lomax. The ladies seem to have a pleasent [sic] time. Miss Hill says that she will surely come to our town again.

Mr. W.D. Adams have [sic] been on the list this week.

There will be a grand excursion from this town to Wilmington Sept. 27th. We hope that everybody will come and go with us to the beautiful seashore.

Yours Correspondent,

## TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS

Having assumed the management of the RECORD. I wish to thank our friends for their very liberal support in the past and ask for a continuance of the same, under our management. It is our aim to give you a clean newspaper with good reading matter. We will say right hear [sic] that the RECORD is controlled by no party or action.

**Our Claim.**  
That the BECORD [sic] is of the Negro for the Negro and by the Negro. We will continue to look after the interests of the Negro. The management is not responsible for ideas expressed by contributors.

Now friends you say you like the RECORD, but that can’t possible [sic] help us unless you pay your subscription.

We have been sending the RECORD to a good number of persons who have never paid one cent for it, and this we [sic] must stop. So if you see a red mark on your paper look for your receipt. We will here give you a sketch of the United States Newspaper Law.

**Newspaper Law**  
Persons taking newspapers from post office or carrier, after 1st copy are considered subscribers and can only discontinue after all arears have been paid all persons subscribing to a newspaper must pay for it or can be indicted [indecipherable].

Publishers of newspapers can, under law, arrest any man who takes a newspaper and refuses to pay for it. Under the law it is a dangerous trick for a man to allow his subscription account to run on from 6 months to a year unpaid, and then tell the postmaster to mark “refused,” or ta [sic] send the editor a postal card to “discontinue the paper.”

So if you wit [sic] hto save any trouble please pay us as we are compelled to get our subscription book straight. Our collector will call on you so be ready for him when he come [sic]. We have just recived [sic] a new lot of type and other material preparatory to enlarging the RECORD, so if you don’t want to get left you had better settle up.

Yours for the race  
F.G. Manly, Manager.

[ ] passing by prec[ ] improve them [ ] precious golden [ ] 

The days are getting shorter, nevertheless the collector will call, before the sun goes down.

The cotton season is on, things will soon be lively. Money will be more frequently in sight, and the Record hopes that there will be no distance, to lend enchantment to the view, but that we may meet the eagle face ta face, look him in the eye.

The question now going rounds is are you for silver or gold? Just at this time we are striving with heart, mind, [ ] and strength for silver, gold, [indecipherable] greenback [ ] thing that will get us some bread, keep off the sheriff and help the preacher.

They say, that Cleveland is dream [sic] of a third term that the “Judge’ has his eyes on the Governor’s chair, that the Fusion shall go on, that the Negro has his eyes open, that he knows a thing or two that in ’96 he will stand by the men who have stood by him, speak well of those who have spoken well of him, do something or him, and let those who are filthy, be filthy still.

[Indecipherable] indications are bright for the [indecipherable] business all over the country [indecipherable] enterprises are starting [indecipherable] South. We hope [indecipherable] past, and that a [indecipherable] hand. Let Hardtimes [indecipherable] and give the poor [indecipherable] and the laborer [indecipherable] get living wages for [indecipherable] wherever you get it, [indecipherable] save some part of [indecipherable] home, make it [indecipherable] won’t visit you [indecipherable]

[Indecipherable] the transgressor is [indecipherable] the “Good Book,” so it [indecipherable] as we sat in the “Tem-[indecipherable] (?) and heard the shy-[indecipherable] law demanding a pound [indecipherable] and saw the keen blade of [indecipherable]-ment grant the claim. The [indecipherable] be respected, her majesty [indecipherable] upheld, but in many cases, the verdict and the sentence, brought to our mind the exclamation that eloquent Roman who cried, “O, judgment! thou hast fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason.”

The popularity of the school is attested by the large enrollment of 260 last year. The dormitories are fitted with all modern conveniences, assuring every necessary comfort to her students. Board, lodging, light, and fuel furnished a student eight months for one hundred dollars. The character of the school is thoroughly Christian, a young man can hardly go through Biddle without finding Christ. Wilmington appreciates the advantages offered at Biddle, and will be well represented. Long may Biddle live! Long may this pure, noble fountain flow to send forth streams knowledge, such as will make strong, noble, Christian men, who champion the cause of humanity and stand for what is beautiful, true, and good.

We are in receipt of a catalogue of Biddle University, Charlotte, N.C.; Rev. D.J. Sanders, D.D. Pres. Biddle is the head of the educational system for the higher education of the colored youth of North Carolina. Its efficient work is seen in the many men of note and influence, who own her as their ‘Alma Mater,’ they are scattered all over this land, and some have gone to over the sea. Biddle today in her success, and growing influence, furnishes one of the strongest arguments in favor of Negro ability, and competence to manage big strings. Its location is [indecipherable], has [ ]  buildings, and includes four schools, Theology Arts and Sciences, Preparatory and Normal and school of Industries and in each she guarantees a thorough course of training. The Faculty is strong, able and experienced, consisting of 11 Professors.

The air is full of politics, the woods are full of politicians. Some clever traps are being set, and some skillful moves are being made upon the political board. In North Carolina the Negro holds the balance of power, which he can use to the advantage of the race, state and nation, if he has the manhood to stand on principles, and contend for the rights of a man. Snap judgment and hasty action mean nothing. We believe that the present condition of things requires us to make haste slowly. Every step should be taken with caution, every move should be made after calm and mature deliberation. While all the views of the old leaders cannot be endorsed. We would remind the young leaders, to be sure you are right, otherwise it will be suicide to go ahead. While concocting a safe remedy for the people, death may be dropped in the pot. Some have already shown their hand, others are lying low, others are sleeping with one eye open. We will wait till the iron is hot, then grasp our sledge and strike at selfishness, corruption and every man who looks as if he wants to use the Negro vote to further personal ends.

## Coleman’s Joke.

The Wakesboro Messenger says W.C. Coleman the wealthiest colored man in the state, was here last week in the interest of the colored exhibit at the Atlanta Exposition. Coleman is so nearly white that no one who does not know him would for an instant suspect that negro blood flows in his veins, and for this reason Eph- the National Hotel porter, cannot be blamed for carrying him to the Hotel and offering him the best the house afforded. It was night and Mr. Smith the proprietor was not present. Coleman humored the joke until Eph had assigned him a room, and then he informed the surprised porter that it was not customary for Negroes to be entertained at hotels in this state, and therefore he would have to ask to be directed to the home of Elder Settle, of the colored Methodist Church. Eph’s eyes did not for several days assume their normal size and color, after this his first experience as a hotel porter with a white colored gentleman.

## BRIDGING THE CHASM.
**Booker T. Washington’s Masterly Address at the Atlanta Exposition – Sounds the Key Note For Racial Progress along Practical Lines – What the great Exposition means to the Negro and the South.**

One third of the population of the South is of the Negro race. No enterprise seeking the material, civil or moral welfare of this section can disregard this element of our population and reach the highest success. I but convey to you Mr. President and Directors, the sentiment of the masses of my race, when I say that in no way have the value and manhood of the American Negro been more fittingly and generously recognized, than by the managers of this magnificent Exposition at every stage of its progress.

It is a recognition which will do more to cement the friendship of the two races than any occurrence since the dawn of our freedom.

Not only this, but the opportunity here afforded, will awaken among us a new era of industrial progress. Ignorant and inexperienced, it is not strange that in the first years of our new life, we began at the top instead bottom, that a seat in Congress or the State Legislature was more sought than real estate or industrial skill, that the political convention, or stump speaking had more attractions than starting a dairy farm or truck garden.

## “Cast Down Your Bucket Where You Are!”

A ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly vessel.

From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen the signal, “Water, Water, we die of thirst.” The answer from the friendly vessel at once came back: “Cast down your bucket where you are.” A second time the signal, “Water, water, send us water.” Went up from the distressed vessel and was answered, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” The Captain of the distressed vessel at last heeding the injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came up full of fresh, sparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon River. To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land, or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the Southern white man who is their next door neighbor, I would say cast down your bucket where you are, cast it down in making friends in every friendly way by the people of all races by whom we are surrounded.

Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in domestic service and in the professions. And in this connection it is well to bear in mind that whatever other sins the South may be called to bear, that when it comes to business pure and simple, it is in the South that the Negro is given a man’s chance in the commercial world, and in nothing is this Exposition more eloquent than in emphasizing this chance. Our greatest danger is, that in the great leap from slavery to freedom, we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of our hand, and fail to keep in mind that we shall prosper in proportion as we learn to Dignify and Glorify Common Labor and put brains and skill into the common occupation of life; shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between the superficial and the substantial, the ornamental gew-gaws of life and the useful. No race can prosper until it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as writing a poem. It is at the bottom of life we must begin and not the top. Nor should we permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities.

To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were I permitted, I would repeat what I say to my own race: “Cast down your bucket where you are.” Cast it down among the 8,000,000 Negroes whose habits you know, whose fidelity and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your fireside.

Cast it down among these people who have without strike and labor wars, tilled your fields, cleaned your forests, builded [sic] your railroads and cities, and brought forth treasures from the bowels of the earth and helped to make possible this magnificent representation of the progress of the South. Casting down your bucket among my people, helping and encouraging them as you are doing on these grounds, and to the education of head, hand and heart, you will find that they will buy your surplus land, make blossom the waste places in your fields, and run your factories. While doing this you can be sure in the future, as you have been in the past, that you and your family will be surrounded by the most patient, faithful, law abiding and unresentful people that the world has ever seen.

## The Negro’s Unfailing Loyalty

As we have proved our loyalty to you in the past, in nursing your children, watching by the sick bed of your mothers and fathers and often following them with tear dimmed eyes to their graves, so in the future in your humble way, we shall stand by you with a devotion that no foreigner can approach, ready to lay down our lives, if need be, in defense of yours, interlacing our industrial, commercial, civil and religious life with yous in a way that shall make interests of both races one. In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.

There is no defense or security of any of us except in the highest intelligence and development of all. If anywhere there are efforts tending to curtail the fullest growth of the Negro, let these efforts be turned into stimulating, encouraging and making him the most useful and intelligent citizen. Effort on means so invested will pay a thousand percent interest. These efforts will be twice blessed. “Blessing him that gives and him that takes.”

There is no escape through law of man or God, from the inevitable: “The laws of changeless justice bind Oppressor with oppressed, And close as sin and suffering joined We march to fate abreast,”

Nearly sixteen millions of hands will and your pulling the load upwards

## BRIDGING THE CHASM

*(Continued from third page.)*

or they will pull against you the load downwards. We shall constitute one third and much more of the ignorance and crime of the South or one third its intelligence and progress, we shall contribute one third to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding every effort to advance the body politic.

Gentlemen of the Exposition: As we present to you our humble effort an exhibition of our progress.

You Must Not Expect Over much starting thirty years ago with ownership here and there in a few quilts and pumpkins and chickens, (gathered from miscellaneous sources) remember that the path that he has led from these to the inventions and production of agriculture. implements buggies, steam engines, news papers, books, stationary, carving, paintings, the management of drug stores and banks, has not been trodden without contact with thorns and thistles.

While we take pride in what we exhibit as a result of our independent efforts, we do not for a moment forget that our part in this exhibition would fall far short of your expectations but for the constant help that has come to our educational life not only from the Southern States, but especially from the Northern philanthropists who have made their gifts a constant stream of blessing and encouragement. The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle, rather than of artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized. It is important, and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercises of these privileges. 

The Opportunity To Earn A Dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera house.

In conclusion, may I repeat that nothing in thirty years has given us more hope and encouragement, and nothing has drawn us so near to you of the white race, as the opportunity offered by this Exposition. And here bending, as it were, over the alter that represents the results of the struggles of your race and mine, both starting, practically empty handed three decades ago. I pledge that in your effort to work out the great and intricate problem which God has laid at the doors of the south, you shall have at times the patient, sympathetic help of my race, only let this be constantly in mind that while from representations in these buildings of the products of fields, of forest, of mine, of factory, letters and art, much good will come, yet far above and beyond material benefits will be that higher good, that let us prey [sic] God will come, in a blotting out of sectional difference and racial animosities and suspicions in a determination to administer absolute justice, in a willing obedience among all classes to the mandates of law, and a spirit that will tolerate nothing but the highest equity in the enforcement of law. This, coupled with our material prosperity, will bring into our beloved south a new Heaven and a new Earth.
