## Criticism Of Schley’s Report. 
**Capt. Taylor Complains Of**  
**Not Receiving any Credit Due to**  
**The Battleship Indiana.**

Washington, Aug 25.- Admiral Sampson has forwarded to the Navy Department the following letters which have passed between himself and Captain Taylor of the battleship Indiana: 

“U.S.S, Indiana, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, August 6, 1898.- Dear Admiral-The report of Commodore Schley on the battle of July 3rd, as as [sic] published, gives credit in the seventh paragraph to four ships and mentions by name their captains, Phillips, Evans, Clark and Cook, and adds, ‘The dense smoke of the combat shut out from my view the Indiana and Gloucester, but as these vessels were closer to your flagship no doubt their part in the conflict was under your immediate observation.’

“2. In your report as published, you make but slight mention of the Indiana, stating that the Iowa and the Indiana having done good work, and not having the speed for their ships were directed by me, etc. 

“3. The result of these reports is that the captains of all the vessels of the line of battle except the Indiana have received personal mention in the official report before the department, while the two smaller vessels have also had distinctive mention, either from the commander-in-chief or the second in command.   

“4. If the official record should be referred to in the future it will appear from its general tone that the Indiana was less deserving than all of her consorts. Leaving out my personal interest in the matter, it is right that I should consider the officers and crew of the ships; and I speak for them as for myself when I speak to you, Admiral, that the above combination of reports will place the ship, in the opinion of the department and the country, markedly below all the other vessels of your squadron. I respectfully submit, sir, that this is injustice to the Indiana and her officers and her crew.

“5. I can say without any disparagement of any other vessel that during the first hour of the fight the Indiana’s gun fire contributed to the destruction of the Oquenedo and the Teresa more than that of any single vessel of our squadron, except one, and equalled [sic] hers. I do not know why the second in command failed to notice the Indiana during this period of our hottest action. I saw the Brooklyn quite plainly. 

“6. An examination of these reports with reference to the Indiana will, I believe, convince you, sir, that they do produce the effect of putting the Indiana below all other vessels of the squadron. If it be your opinion, sir, that this is the case, and that all the vessels from the Brooklyn to the Vixen, rendered services as much more valuable than the Indiana as the published report of the commander-in-chief and the second in command, taken together, would indicate, then I must accept it for myself and the ship; if, on the contrary, that be not your opinion, I urge respectfully that such steps be taken to remedy this injustice as may seem wise to you.

“Very respectfully,   
H.C. Taylor,  
“Captain U.S Navy, Command’g.” 

## Sampson’s Reply.  

“U.S.S. New York, Guantanamo Bay, August 8, 1898. -Sir- I am greatly obliged that you have called my attention to what appears to have been an injustice to your ship, officers and crew for the part which they took in the action of July 3rd, and also for the very proper manner in which you have represented it. I think, however, that you will agree with me that in submitting such a report to the Secretary of the Navy where so many officers are vitally interested, and justly proud of their ship, it is no easy task to do so without apparently bestowing praise unjustly. It requires very careful consideration of the report from every point of view to avoid misunderstanding.    

“2. The position of the ships of the squadron must be carefull [sic] concidered [sic] to fully appreciate what it was [sic] possible for each vessel to accomplish under the circumstances in which she was placed. Those that were to the westward of the escaping enemy were certainly better placed for stopping the enemy, and also better placed for delivering their fire than the vessels to the eastward which was the blockading station of the Indiana.  

“3. No distribution of the fleet could completely predict and provide against every variation of such a sortie [sic], nor do I consider that any commanding officer deserved either credit or blame because the ship under his command was faster or slower than another ship or carried a heavier or lighter battery, but rather that the commanding officer was blameworthy when he failed to put his ship in the proper place for destroying the enemy: but in proportion to the advantage which he possessed in speed, battery, oa [sic] position over his neighbors.

“4. Each commanding officer, in my opinion, was personally responsible for the good use which he made of the tools with which he had to work. I certainly did not intend to criticize you, nor to bestow less praise upon the Indiana than was bestowed upon any other ship of the squadron.

“5. The fact that the commanding officer of the blockade was signalled [sic] to return to blockade at the mouth of the harbor after she so gallantly contributed to the destruction of the Spanish ships was only a necessary precaution which the commander-in-chief felt obliged to take to prevent disaster to the large number of transports which were left in that vicinity when the fleet started in pursuit of the enemy. There were still some armed vessels remaining in the harbor of Santiago-at least two, and we did know then how many more--which could have come out in the absence of the fleet and produced great havoc among the troopships, which were defenseless in the absence of an armed vessel.

“6. This explanation, together with your letter, will be sent to the department with the request that it may be attached to and form a [text obscured] Respectfully,

“W.T Sampson,  
“Rear Admiral, U.S.N

## Soldiers Arrived.
(By wire to the Recorp.)

Jersey City, Aug. 26.—Nearly one thousand soldiers belonging to the New England regiments have arrived and are on the way home. The larger number consists of the First Maine Volunteers over half of the total number troops were ill when they reached here. There have occurred two deaths since leaving Chicamauga, and several others are believed dying. The troops are all in an emaciated condition and look nothing like the strong, robust soldiers who who [sic] passed here a few months previous. They tell of the terrible privations insufficient food and exposure.

Paris, Aug.26.-A dispatch [sic] from says Lord Charles Beresford to whom has been intrusted [sic] the special mission in the Far East, is bearer of the preliminary treaty of alliance offensive and defensive between Great Britain and Japan. Lord Beresford will submit the treaty to the Emperor wo is expected to receive it favorable in which event Beresford is empowered to conclude it.

New York, Aug.6, 2:20 p.m.-  Dr. Kennely [sic], the alleged murderer of Dolly 

Reynolds waived examination in Police court to-day, held without bail for the Grand Jury.

## As To The Executive Committee.
**Resolutions Passed Denouncing The Record.**
**Resolutions Drawn Up By a White Man--- Signed By Colored Men.**  

The Democratic papers were filled yesterday with accounts of the resolutions adopted by the Republican Executive Committee of New Hanover County, in which THE RECORD was publicly denounced by them after the manner of **C. P. LOCKY,** a white lawyer here who wishes to be elected to the judgeship upon the votes of the Negroes of this Judicial District. In this article we shall proceed to deal with the members of that committee and will leave **MR. LOCKY** for another time. 

The resolutions adopted by those misrepresentatives of the people of this county are as follows: 

Whereas, A little paper published in this city (Wilmington) called the Daily Record, printed in its issue of a recent date (August 18, 1898) an article which is a base and vile [text obscured] upon countless thousands of [text obscured] poor white people living [text obscured] country especially- and 

“Whereas, The Democratic papers here have copied said article, and given it prominence, and seeking to place the responsibility of its composition and publication upon the Republican party for political purposes, declaring that said paper (The Daily Record) is the organ of the Republican Populist fusion polical [sic] crowd, etc. and 

“Whereas, In truth and in fact, the said Daily Record is not now nor never has been the Republican or fusion organ, and is not even regegarded [sic] by our party as a republican or fusion paper, but is generally classed and regarded as a kicking, disorganizing concern, being published by a few individuals who seem to think of nothing but their own importance and aggrandizement, and edited by an irresponsible upstart, who represents only himself and his own views in what he writes, now. 

“Resolved, That we denounce  the article referred to as a base libel, we repudiate and denounce the writer of it as a mischief-making simpleton. We declare that he represents and expresses only his own views and sentiments in said article, and we urge and all republicans who are now taking The Record to discontinue it, and leave it to be supported by the Democrats whose interest it is now serving and advancing by its foolish and reprehensible con-
duct.  

“Resolved, further, That we denounce and condemn the course and and [sic] action of the Democratic papers in trying to place the responsibility of the libelous article upon the republican party, when they either know or could easily have ascertained, that our party not only did not endorse the article, but condemned it equally as strongly as they did.”

These men who are supposed to represent the people are colored men, every one of them. They take occasion to accept a set of resolutions drafted and introduced by a white man, who accepts the prejudiced view of a PART [sic] of our article of the 18th as misinterpreted by the Democratic papers. These men are for the most part fathers of families and some of them, before the meeting of this committee, said to us that any honest unprejudiced man would condemn, but note the changes.

John W. Lee, chairman; J. E. Howard, secretary, and Stephen Washington, Chas. Stanford, J. P. Bowen, A. H. Lamb, Chas. A. Foreman, Daniel Howard, Wm Johnson, Samuel Reese, Jordan Nixon, and Geo. Green, were called into executive session and they proceed to denounce, by revolution, the identical thing they endorsed as individuals. 

In conversation with one of the members of the committee, Dan Howard at his house a few minutes before the meeting, he told us that a meeting was called, showed us the summons to attend and also informed us of the import of the meeting. What was his motive? Was it to dupe us into the belief that he was our friend, and that in telling us of the proposed action of the committee we would not condemn him with the rest? [illegible]

Now let’s observe this committee a little more closely. Read their names over again so that you won’t forget them. Save this issue of this paper for future reference. Read these resolutions to your wives and daughters. Tell them of the action of these men in this matter- how they, without submitting us or our writing to trial, condemns us unheard- and that too at the instance of a politician who expects the Negro voters to elect him to office. 

They claim that the Republican party is not responsible for the article above refered [sic] to, and that the writer should be denied the patronage of every Republican who has heretofore subscribed to our paper. We want to say right here that never since we began the publication of The Record have those who assume to dictate the political policy of the people here been allowed to dictate the policy of this paper. 

Now let’s observe MR. LOCKY: Had the Populist Judicial Convention, which convened in Warsaw a few days since, left the nomination of Judge as it had been fixed by MR.  LOCKY, HE, MR. LOCKY, would not have seen so much objection to our article of the 18th nor would HE have drafted the resolutions so hurridly [sic] adopted in that meeting of Wednesday. 

MR. LOCKY’S motives are plain: HE is not so anxious for upholding the so-called dignity of the Republican party as HE was to placate the Populists who HE feels, and justly so, must be called upon to elect HIM to HIS most coveeted [sic] office. 

MR. LOCKY desires, through his resolutions, to make it appear that The Record is  being edited by a “mischief-making Simpleton.” This may be true, but suppose we ask the wise and learned aspirant for the judicial erminie [sic] why it was that HE hovered so much around the Record office and why was it that HE requested us to accompany him to Washington upon a 
mission not essentially such as “simpletons” usually perform?

In HIS haste to placate the Populists and to set HIMSELF in line with the Democrat,  MR. LOKEY [sic] forgets that the Negro VOTERS are not all “BOOT LICKING” polititicians, [sic] and that despite the denunciations of that “BOOT LICKING” committee, they will stand by us in our fight for justice and fair play. 

MR. LOCKEY [sic] informs the public that “The Record will suspend.” How does he know that? What right does HE more than anyone else to assume that this paper will stop publication? We have placed our cause in the hands of the Negro people of this community and the state at large, and they, MR. LOCKEY or his Committee, [sic] shall be arbiters  of our destiny. 

## England and Russia. 

London, Aug. 26.- The dispatch cabled from London to New York to the effect that Lord Salisbury before leaving for France informed Her Majesty, the Queen, that in the present critical state [text obscured] with Russia he must resign unless her frequently expressed veto upon the prosecution of diplomacy to the point of war during her lifetime was withdrawn and he was given an absolutely free hand, and that there upon the ministry made definite proposals to Russia, which in effect amounted to an ultimatum, is an elaboration of the current gossip of the clubs and the sensational weeklies, and is obviously impossible of confirmation or denial. Circumstancial [sic]evidence goes to disaprove [sic] the statement. 

Lord Salisbury has been spending his vacation since Parliament adjourned in France. Sir Thomas Henry Sandarson, Permanent Under Secretary of the State for Foreign Affaires [sic], and others most important officials of the Foreign Office, and likewise the Russian ambassador to Great Britain, M. de Staal, have been on the continent for a long time. Apparently there are no important negotiations afoot. 

England abandoned the open-door policy because Russia closed the door in her face, as has been pointed out, and retreated to the policy of spheres of influence, because it is necessary to appear to have some Chinese policy.  

Two British ships were withdrawn from the Chinese waters yesterday. 

London, Aug. 26.- A dispatch to a news agency from Shanghai reports that the available British fleet in Chinese waters has arrived at Wai-Hai-Wai to support the demands of Sir Claude MacDonald, British minister to China. There is no confirmation of the report obtainable from other sources.

## A PHILIPPINE ROMANCE
**ADVENTURES IN THE ISLANDS OF A GENTLEMAN OF BRITTANY**

De la Gironniere, Whom Dumas Once Described as a Phantom, Went to Manila, Founded a Colony, Subdued Pirates and Married a Creole Beauty.

About the middle of the present century, when Dumas the elder was at the height of his career, and the origin of many an interesting piece of French literature was delightfully uncertain, a couple of works appeared that drew attention to the mysterious and far off Philippines. In his “Thousand and One Phantoms,” issued serially in the Constitutionnel [sic], Dumas made free with a fellow countryman who had been the hero of certain surprising adventures in the Pearl of the Orient, and the hero thereupon not caring to figure as a phantom in a feuilleton, got out his “Adventures of a Gentlemen of Brittany in the Philippines.” Some persons, however, thought the hero would have been truer to life as the creation of Dumas; that as a real gentleman of Brittany he was only another living liar, and that, in fact, his romantic narrative was the work of a new Selkirk and Defoe combination.

“Paul Proust de la Gironniere was counted in the pedigree of an ancient Piedmontese family that came over the St. Bernard and into Brittany in the days of Louis XIV., and soon became rich enough to have access to the nobility and to contract “the most flattering alliances.” Paul’s father was born at Nantes, where his ancestors had held high office under the crown. His wealth was swept away by the revolution; and he died on a piece of land owned by his wife. Paul’s mother gave the boys such education as she could, and then they went to seek their fortune. One died in Madagascar; another returned to Porto Rico to die in his mother’s arms; the husband of one of Paul’s sisters died in Mauritius, and another brother died while visiting Paul in the Philippines. 

Paul was born at Nantes; he studied medicine; and thence, a mere stripling, he sailed as ship’s surgeon to the Far East, embarking for the fourth time on October 9, 1819, and casting anchor about the end of May, 1820, in the Bay of Manila He landed at Cavite, enjoyed the whirl of Manila society, studied the Tagaloc, went among the natives in the mountains, began the career of sportsmanship that was to culminate in hunting the stag and the buffalo and in killing caymans and boa constrictors, and finally allowed his ship to go home and leave him in the metropolis of the archipelago.

He had resolved to become a resident physician. He faced the fanaticism of the cholera massacre of 1820, and he had a clean shirt in his hat and a dollar in his pocket. Finding a rich old don nearly blind, he cured one eye and made a glass ball for the socket of the other, and his reputation was established. Paul became Dr. Pablo, and surgeon  of a regiment of regulars and of a battalion of militia. But when the leaders of the Novalles rebellion of 1823 were shot, he had occasion to call a Spanish informer a coward, and some time thereafter, having words with the Governor-General over a question of ethics, he resigned and was thenceforth a sort of surgical free lance to the people of Luzon.

The travels of la Gironniere in the island, though undertaken incidentally to professional duty or out of mere curiosity or a desire to go somewhere, are scientifically interesting, and will be as important to the historian as many of the manuscript accounts that are rolled up in the cloistral archives. He explored caves, lakes, mountain fastnesses and immense forests; slept in treetops and on the tidal sands; learned the ways of the tribes and gathered legends; attended the Tinguian brain feast; sketched the interior of Igorrot huts and carried off the skeleton of a Negro woman.

La Gironniere’s most valuable contribution to the civilization of the island was his colony of Jala-Jala. Before his resignation had been accepted, Senor Pablo, who was known among the natives as Malamit Oulou, or “Cool Head,” had secured of the Minister of Finance a site for model farm in the mountainous peninsula that extends southward into the beautiful Lake of Bay at the head of the Pasig. Here, with his devoted wife, and commissioned to subdue as he might the pirates and banditti of this wild region, he founded among these victims of Spain’s extortion and misrule a prosperous and orderly community. Assisted by these industrious and loving neighbors, and heartily seconded by the once dreaded Chieftain Alila, by a Malay-Japanese priest whom the Archbishop had told him nobody could ever live with, and by his ever inspiring Anna, the “Queen of Jala Jala,” he converted a forest and a malarial swamp into a thriving town surrounded with timber land, pasture grounds, and rich fields of rice, indigo, sugar cane, tobacco, and coffee. 

His herds alone comprised 3000 head of oxen, 800 buffaloes and 600 horses. For the introduction and perfection of coffee culture, he received a prize of $7000 from the Spanish Government. Here he built a church and school, large warehouses and a manufactory, and the travelers who visited his colony were hospitably entertained in an elegant residence that he erected for the comfort of the wife whose early death sent him back to France a crushed and disheartened man. 

Mme. de la Gironniere was a native of the Philippines, and it was owing to Paul’s Creole marriage that he obtained concession until then obstinately refused to foreigners. An American friend had called his attention to a young lady in mourning who passed for one of the most beautiful senoras of the town, and all the salons of Binodocn for an introduction, when one day, as he was writing a prescription for a chance patient in one of the fine houses in the Faubourg of Santa Cruz the sudden rustling of a silk dress was followed by the apparition of the  lady. She was eighteen years of age. Her features were regular and placid, her hair black and beautiful, and her eyes large and expressive. This was Anna-Maria Favea, Marquesa de las Salinas, the wealthy and charming young widow of a colonel of the guards who had married her when but a child. 	Paul stammered, got out of the house awkwardly, went home in a fever, called again, and six months later was the husband of an excellent wife. Her fortune, $136,000, invested in a Mexican venture, was seized by Colonel Iturbide, who became Emperor of Mexico, and was dethroned and shot. This excellent woman bore every trial with patience. She followed her husband with the most unbounded confidence. She welcomed the European visitors who came to the colony, and she put clothes on the backs of the dalagas. Quietly she laid her little girl in the grave, and uncomplainingly, as she bid adieu to the boy who was soon to follow, she went down into herself. She was a teacher of goodness; the narrative of le gentilhomme breton sinks to a song for the dead upon every mention of her worth; and the cross of the Legion of Honor, accorded him at the request of Marshal Soult, was little recompense for the other self that he had lost in the Lady of Jala- Jala New York Sun.

## SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL

Altitudes are calculated from barometric records according to a formula worked out by Laplace.

Ozone, on account of its powerful oxidizing action on organic matter, plays a considerable part in purifying the air.

A system of 100 electrically operated clocks at Brussels, Belgium, has been in use, with some modifications, since April, 1857.

A comet has been discovered at the Lick Observatory in the constellation Scorpio, about one degree northeast of the bright star Antares.

Liquid air mixed with powdered charcoal as an explosive has been tried experimentally in the Penzberg coal mine near Munich, Bavaria.

The machine-made American file has come into such sharp competition with the European hand-made implement that legislation against the American production may soon be expected.

Two of the sets of negatives made by the English observers of the recent eclipse at Viziadrug, in India, have arrived in England, and are being studied thoroughly by the astronomers.

A contract for 36,000 tons of steel rails and 4230 tons of fishplates, for use on the Eastern Chinese Railway, now building in Manchuria, has been entered into with American manufacturers.
\
Many manufacturers are using X-rays to test coal that they use in their operations, it having been found that by turning the rays on coal it can be told how much of it will remain as ashes after it is burned and how much will escape as gas. 

Cloth is now being made from wood. Strips of fine-grained wood are boiled and crushed between rollers, and the filaments, having been carded into parallel lines, are spun into threads, from which the cloth can be woven in the usual way.

## Russia’s Priceless Jewels.

“A whole guide-book devoted simply to the Hermitage could give no sort of idea of the barbaric splendor of its belongings,” writes Lilian Bell, of the famous St. Petersburg Museum, in the Ladies’ Home Journal. “Its riches are beyond belief. Even the presents given by the Emir of Bokhara to the Czar are splendid enough to dazzle one like a realization of the Arabian Nights. But to see the most valuable of all, which are kept in the Emperor’s private vaults, is to be reduced to a state of bewilderment bordering on idiocy. It is astonishing enough, to one who has bought even one Russian belt set with turquoise enamel, to think of all the trappings of a horse—bit, bridle saddle-girth, saddle-cloth and all-- made of cloth of gold and set in solid turquoise enamel, with the sword hilt, scabbard, belts and pistol handle and holster made of the same. Well, these are there by the roomful. Then you come to the private jewels, and you see all these same accoutrements made of precious stones--one of solid diamonds, another of diamonds, emeralds, topazes and rubies.”

## Americans Shut Out of the Philippines.

As is well known, American was supreme in the Philippine trade from the opening of the export business of the island on a large scale until within a few years. The reasons for the decline of American influence were largely the drawing out of capital by the older members of the great American trading firms, and their leaving the business to younger members of their families, who found themselves with great responsibilities and a reduced capital. Gradually English firms, with abundant capital, succeeded to the bulk of business. The last American firms in Manila were crowded out three years ago by Spanish intrigues, caused by the hatred of American growing out of the Cuban troubles. This overthrow was managed by the thousand and one petty annoyances of legal machinery that the Spaniards exerted against American firms.

## AGRICULTURAL TOPICS 

**Sooty Fungus on Apples.**  
To prevent the sooty fungus on apples, there is no question that bordeaux applied at the intervals of about two weeks from the middle of June until the middle of August will prove effectual. Under favorable conditions this fungus attacks most varieties of apples and pears, but on all it may be controlled by the use of bordeaux mixture.

**Rape For Poultry.**  
Green foods for poultry are advised and among them rape. For a supply of green food for summer use, rape should be sown at any time up to the middle of July. Prepare the ground as for root crops and sow the seed broadcast or in drills thirty inches apart. Cover about the same as turnip seed and cultivate until it gets a fair start. It will grow rapidly and may be cut and fed to fowl, although if sown in rows by the drill the poultry may be turned into the patch once or twice a week. One or two pounds of seed will sow an acre, drilled in, and will supply green food for a large flock of fowls until late in the fall.

**The Sweet Pea.**  
A beautiful flower is the sweet pea. Its exquisite fragrance has made it a favorite, while its beauty and grace are of the highest kind. Cultivation has increased it in size, and it has also developed its variety in color. At the same time, experienced florists have discovered short methods of giving it various tints, so that it is almost impossible for a person not a professional to determine whether a bunch of these lovely blossoms has taken its color from nature or from the chemist’s dish. The difficulty is complicated by the fact that nature and art can each give at least a dozen different dyes.--New York Mail and Express.

**Sheep For Clearing Land.**  
Wherever woodland is cleared a flock of sheep is extremely valuable to keep the cleared soil from being overgrown with the bushes, weeds and shrubs which usually come up in following years. It is desirable to get the cleared land in grass as soon as possible. When it is once seeded down it may be pastured with sheep all through the summer, not only without injuring the grass, but positively benefiting it [sic], as the sheep will devote most of their time to trimming down the bushes and eating the leaves which shade the land. To make more thorough destruction of the shrubbery, an excess of sheep should be put in the cleared lot, and these must be fed some grain, so as to make their browse diet digest better.--American Cultivator. 

**Caring For Tulips.**  
A correspondent of the Practical Farmer tells how she manages her tulip bed. For several years she took up the bulbs annually, but found it both laborious and rather unsatisfactory. Finally she planted her bulbs in a long bed, a yard wide, setting them five inches apart each way. When the tulips faded and the foliage began to die down, instead of lifting the bulbs she left them in their places and set in the center of each square, formed by the bulbs, an aster plant, started in a cold frame. In cultivating the soil during the summer, care was taken not to go deep enough to injure the tulip bulbs. After frost killed the asters she pulled them up and filled the holes with fine manure from the barnyard. The next spring her tulips were larger and handsomer than ever before.

**Feeding Unthreshed Oats**  
Oat straw, it is conceded, has a value as food too great to permit of its use as bedding. If the practice of feeding oats unthreshed was more general a still greater saving would result. Cut the crop several days before the grain ripens, which will leave the straw in better condition, and save a loss of the grain from the heads in handling. If cut with a mower they should be cut greener than when put up in bundles. The oats may be kept in a stack out of doors if properly protected, but, it is best to put them up in bundles and stack them on end in the barn. In feeding, the coarse butt ends of the stalks should be cut off and used for bedding, the rest of the stalk being run through a cutter. Both horses and cattle seem to relish unthreshed oats, and fed in this way the tendency, on the part of horses, to bolt the grain is overcome and the thorough mastication of both grain and straw will keep the animals in good condition.

**Taints in Milk**  
Many users of ensilage and certain root crops complain of the taints of these foods absorbed by the milk. As a rule, there is nothing in the [illegible] plants [illegible] as ensilage is [illegible] sweet ensilage. Decayed ensilage is not only worthless as a food, but will taint the milk and often produce irregularities in the cow. Examination of structure of a cow’s digestive organs and close observation of the action of foods in the stomach, disclose the fact that after eating anything likely to taint the milk it is an hour or more before the effect of such foods would be noticed in the milk even as closely connected as are stomach and milk ducts. On the other hand, the danger of taint is likely to remain for many hours, usually about ten, after the food is eaten. A simple way, therefore, to avoid all danger from possible taints is to give such foods as roots so that at least ten hours will elapse after feeding before milking is done. For this reason the feeding of turnips, carrots or any other foods likely to taint the milk is done at night after milking.-- Atlanta (Ga.) Journal.

## Doom of the Locomotive
**[illegible] is a possibility of a Locomotorless Age**

About 100 years ago Oliver Evans, the creator, was rash enough to say that the time would come when his high pressure locomotive would take people after breakfast in Washington and get them to New York for supper. The idea of covering over 200 miles in this time was, of course, preposterous, and he was the butt of many a joke. But when the rails were finally laid, which was not so many years ago, the passengers soon began to want more speed, and thus it has gone on. Americans accept inventions as marvels for a whole day sometimes, and then demand more. Some people have been known to complain of the telephone.

But the locomotive has been a faithful old friend. Locomotive Engineering goes so far as to say it “was always kept equal to any speed requirements put upon it,” and that the only obstacles to fast trains a half century ago were the tracks and the lack of signals and the absence of efficient means of stopping the trains. How human this sounds. If we only had the right sort of tracks, the proper warnings and the power to stop, how many of us would arrive at our destination in time to [illegible] on success and prosperity, instead of getting sidetracked or wrecked.

It is a fact, however, that the locomotive has kept strictly up with the times, and few of us care to travel faster than on the limited trains that allow us to break our fast in Washington and take our luncheon in New York-a beggarly five hours of smooth motion that could easily be reduced to four if the railroads wanted to do it. But the faithful old puller, varying in size from the shifting, if not shiftless busybody that puffs around stations to the marvelous machine of a hundred tons, is reading the handwriting along its tracks. The electrical motor, dumpy and ugly, is preparing to retire its handsome rival. It is like a mean little torpedo boat sending the beautiful full-rigged man-of-war into retirement; but it represents force, and force rules. Millions upon millions of dollars are represented in these locomotives, but even millions cannot prevent the advent of invention. And so, after awhile, the old locomotive may be as rare as the old street car horse; but let us be grateful for what it has done and admit that the man was almost right when he called it “the plowshare of civilization,” for wherever its whistle has been heard progress has found a way and the furrow has been plowed.—Leslie’s Weekly.

## Whaling By Modern Methods
**Explosive Lances Have Superseded the Harpoons Formerly in Use**

The weapons with which a well-armed modern whaling vessel is equipped are probably the most savage and deadly known to warfare. The enormous strength of the average whale makes the contest with a small boat, even under the most favorable conditions, very unequal.

Capt. A. E. Folger, of New York, otherwise knows [sic] as “Whale Oil Gus,” who has spent 30 years on whaling vessels, has accumulated a very curious collection of these deadly weapons. The most barbarous is a bomb-lance. In whaling, the main object of the hunter is to securely fasten a harpoon in the whale’s flesh. The old style of fishing consists in merely throwing a barbed harpoon at a whale with sufficient force to fasten it to its body. It often happened that this crude instrument was torn out of the flesh and the whale was lost.

The bomb-lance consists of a long, thin cartridge, at one end of which is fixed a very sharp steel lance. The bomb-lance is fired with great accuracy and force from a gun especially constructed for the purpose. The bomb is provided with a fuse, which is set on fire automatically when it is discharged and burns for three seconds before exploding the bomb itself. This gives the bomb time to strike the whale and become imbedded [sic] in its flesh before it explodes. These bombs are filled with a pound of powder, so that the result of the explosion is very likely to be fatal.

The bomb-harpoon is constructed on the same general plan, except that the harpoon is much heavier and the bomb much larger. This interesting weapon is fired from a gun weighing 250 pounds or more, the harpoon itself weighing about 40 pounds. A rope is attached to the end of the harpoon, the other end of which is, of course, held in the boat. It is custormary [sic], Capt.  Folger says, to open fire on a whale with the light musketry, a bomb-lance or so, and then immediately to follow with a broadside of bomb-harpoons.—N.Y. World.

## Testing Tobacco in Cuba.

The testing of tobacco is a fine art, which reaches its finest in Cuba. The Cuban’s first test is by the smell. He can detect the slightest variation in odor and instantly rejects the tobacco as not belonging to the best grade. Then he takes the leaf, rolls a rude-looking cigar out of it and lights it. He gives one or two puffs and then inhales the smoke. Thus he determines the flavor very accurately. Next he watches the way the cigar burns and finally tests the ashes. If the cigar will not hold its fire four minutes—the best qualities of all should go until five minutes – the tobacco is not of the best. The tobacco should also hold its ashes until the cigar is burnt nearly to the middle. –Chicago Times-Herald.

## Millionaires in the Senate.
**[illegible] Men in the Upper House Began at the Bottom of the Ladder.**

[illegible] Senate is frequently [illegible] s’ club, because [illegible] belong to that [illegible] fortunes are denoted by six figures,” said a senator and a millionaire recently, “and this gives a wrong impression of the character of that body. To be sure, many of the senators are millionaires, and there are some who, while not so fortunate as to be listed as millionaires, are very rich men, but I am not stating it broadly when I say the majority of the wealthy men in the senate have only themselves to thank for their riches. Many of them began life as poor boys, and worked and struggled their way to prominence and success, and the same enterprise that made them wealthy makes them successful politicians. It is not always to his money that a man owes his seat in the upper house, and a man’s self-earned wealth should entitle him to the respect rather than the sneers of his contemporaries.

This is quite true. The majority of the senators began life in humble circumstances, and one of the most interesting of these self-made men is Senator Fairbanks, or Indiana, successor to the late Senator Voorhees. Senator Fairbanks is of Yankee origin, and those characteristics common to the descendants of the Puritans have been useful to him in his career. His father was born in Vermont, but went west as far as Ohio when he was a young man and settled there. He was a wagon maker by trade and worked at first for 37 ½ cents a day, but his application, perseverance and faithfulness won him the regard and esteem of his employer, who finally took him into partnership and gave him his daughter in marriage. 

But Mr. Fairbanks, Sr., never became a rich man. The present senator was born in a log cabin, and by working at carpentering on Saturdays and during the vacations helped to pay his way through the Ohio Wesleyan university, of which college he is an alumnus. After leaving college Senator Fairbank’s first real work was the Associated Press, and he maintained himself doing newspaper work while he was studying law and until he was admitted to the bar. He attributes his success in life to steady application to one purpose, that of becoming a successful lawyer. From this purpose he never swerved until he was made senator. Political preferment did not tempt him, and his present office is the first political place he has held.

But Senator Fairbanks is not the only one among his colleagues who has won his way to honor and distinction from a modest beginning. Senator Foraker, being one of the 11 children, had, perhaps, even a harder struggle with poverty, and to this discipline which he received in the army, which he entered at 16, serving until the close of the war, when he retired with the rank of first lieutenant and brevet captain, his success in life is largely due. –N.Y. Tribune.

## A Hermit Because He Likes It.
**John Starnes Took to the Woods During the War and Is There Still.**

Thirty-five years ago John Starnes lived near Blacksburg, York county, and only a few miles from the battlefields of Cowpens and King’s mountain, where the Americans whipped the British. The proximity of the battlefields did not inspire a warlike spirit in the breast of Starnes. During the war the conscription officers cast covetous eyes on the mountaineer’s stalwart frame, and Starnes took to the woods. They searched for him, but Starnes was a better runner that an fighter, and he kept out of the way, out of the war, and in the woods. He had an old musket and a supply of ammunition, and fare in the woods was better than in the town. Starnes became fond of the life, and when the war was over and conscription officers had lost their dreaded power, Starnes still remained in the wilds of York.

And there he is now living. His home is not a romantic cave in the rocks, but is a curiously constructed, miserable hut, much the shape of an Eskimo snow house, without a window, and with a hole about two feet high, which serves as a door. There is no fireplace in the house. When snow is on the mountain and the north winds howl over the Blue Ridge the old man builds a fire at the entrance of his hut.

Starnes is not a picturesque figure. His long, white, unkempt hair and beard, and the ragged clothes that can hardly hang on his frame, make him an unprepossessing object. The hermit does not like to have visitors, and shows temper if questioned. He forages on his neighbors. He has relatives who have offered him a home and [illegible]ing in comfort, but the hermit has declined all advances. His neighbors call him “Wild John Starnes,” but the hermit says he is “not so damned wild as you might suppose.”—N.Y.Sun.

## “The Weeping of the Vine.”

After the spring pruning in the vineyards water is seen trickling down the stems, and in France this is poetically called the “weeping of the vine.” Prof. Cernu, a botanist, has recently studied this phenomenon, and he says it is due to the abundant absorption of water by the roots of the vine in the springtime. The water is forced through all the branches and stems to their very tips, and where they are cut by the pruner it oozes out like tear drops.’’ --Youth’s Companion.

## Untimely.

“Do you know what you are trying to say,” asked the chronic fault finder, “when you speak of a man going to an untimely grave at the age of 80?”

“I do,” said the undaunted obituarist.

“The old villain ought to have gone [illegible] 40 years ago.”

## An Impediment.
Teacher (angrily)—Why don’t you answer my question, Bobby?

His Brother Tommy (answering for him)—Please, sir, he’s got a peppermint in his speech.—Tit Bits.

## Angry for Thirty Years.
**Because His Wife Sewed the Wrong Button on His Vest.**

Because Mrs. Marion W. Hatton threw a stool at him and sewed a pants button on his vest nearly 30 years ago, Theodore Hatton wants an absolute divorce says the Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald. The action is brought in the state of Illinois, and evidence is being taken in this city, both for the plaintiff and the defendant. The parties are well advanced down the toboggan of time, the defendant being upward of 50 years old and the plaintiff at least as aged.

There are some interesting things about the case. Until about 1872 the Hattons lived near Amboy, supposedly happy, as all married people are to be considered until they reach the courts. One day the plaintiff, after a quarrel with his wife, which neither claim was regarded more than a trivial matter, left his home and went west. He was heard from at various times, but no contributions to the support of his wife and child were received.

A short time ago Mrs. Hatton heard that her husband had brought suit for divorce, and that judgement was about to be entered by default. The matter looked irregular, as Mrs. Hatton had never, she says, received a service of the papers or an intimation of the litigation until informed by an acquaintance. An answer was put in denying the charges made and alleging the facts as Mrs. Hatton and the people about Amboy remember them. It is said that Hatton, since living in Chicago, his present residence, has accumulated some property.

## Lincoln’s Mother’s Grave.
**A Lonely Tomb on a Wooded Hill in Indiana.**

The recent communication between President McKinley and Gov. Mount in which the former called the attention of the latter to the neglected grave of Nancy Hanks, mother of Abraham Lincoln, has attracted attention from all over the country to the grave. It is located on a hill of gradual ascent and is right in the middle of the woods about a mile from Lincoln City, a little station on the Air Line road in Spencer county, Ind. It is inclosed [sic] by an iron fence, which separates it from a number of other graves around it, and has a neat headstone which gives the name, age, etc., of the occupant. An inscription also says: “Erected by a Friend of her Martyred Son, 1879.” It is comparatively isolated, and any improvement made in its surroundings would not prove of any value.
	
In order to fittingly honor the dead the people of that vicinity suggest that the remains be taken up by the state and reinterred at Indianapolis, or that the United States reinter them in some national cemetery. A $1,000 shaft could be placed over it where it now stands and ten persons in a year would not see it unless they made a special trip there.

## New Western Idea.
**Girls Who Give Gold Models of Their Little Fingers**

“Do little girls here give gold models of their little fingers to their fiances [sic]?” asked the western girl of the Gothamite, reports the New York Sun.

“Heaven, No! answered the Gothamite. “It seems to me that that is a rather grewsome [sic] souvenir.”

“Not at all,” answered the western girl. “It is decidedly dainty, and I’m a little surprised that New York is so far behind the times. The fad started in this way: When the daughter of one of our big western politicians was six months old he had a model of her little finger cast in gold. Around the little dimpled digit is a ring of turquoise, which is her birthstone, and it makes a lovely charm for her betrothed’s watch chain. He valued it so much that it set other men to thinking, and the result is that as soon as a girl wraps one of these chaps around her little finger sufficiently for a proposal to follow, he immediately insists upon a gold facsimile of the flesh and blood original. It is a pretty conceit, and is being followed by every westerner who is in subjection to somebody’s little finger.”

## Concerning “Purfessors.”

The misuse of the title “professor” as often vulgarly applied to musicians in general finds a laughable example in the following story credited to Bandmaster Sousa. It seems that some years ago, before the existence of the organization, which bears his name, and before “The Washington Post,” “Liberty Bell,” “Cotton King: and “El Capitan” had made the American march king famous, he was leading a band in the government service, at some small country festival. The advent of the band had been awaited with intense interest by [illegible] consequence, the bandsmen were soon surrounded by a surging crowd which hemmed them in so that it became well-nigh an impossibility for them to keep on playing. Sousa pointed out the fact to a local official, adding that unless the crowd fell back his band would have to stop. That personage shook his head warmly, and turning to the assembled multitude, bawled out: “Gentlemen, step back and give the purfessor’s purfessoors a chance to play!”

## A Clever Ruse.

It was an ingenious ruse that a prisoner who escaped from a South Carolina prison recently hit upon to throw bloodhounds off his track. The convict was tracked by the dog to a farmhouse, where he had begged breakfast. He stole a pepperbox, and after leaving the house peppered his tracks. The dog almost died from the effects of the pepper and had to be called off.

## New Wire Gun.

As projectile from the new wire gun in a recent trial completely penetrated an 18-inch steel faced compound armor plate backed by a six-inch wrought iron plate, by eight feet of solid oak and three inches of iron and was found imbedded in a clay bank 35 yards behind the target.

## A SERIOUS CLASH
**U.S Soldiers and the Philippine Rebels At Cavite.**  
**Trpooships [sic] Arrive Bringing Soldiers Home.**  
**A Light-Weight Pugilist Knocked And killed.**

Manila, Aug.26- There has been a serious clash between United States and the insurgents. the riot resulting in one soldier killed and another seriously wounded.  George Hudson, a member of the Utah battery, became involved in a dispute with a native shopkeeper, fearing trouble he fired his revolver to attract attention of a fellow soldier. A great crowd of natives ran to the scene of disturbance and began the firing of revolvers, killing Hudson and wounding corporal Wm Anderson, of the same battery, who also hurried to their assistance. A detachment of the Fourth Cavalry was called out and dispersed the crowd who slowly retreated continuing to emty [sic] their revolvers without further damage. The same night the soldier on guard duty saw a large body of natives stripping the wreck of the gunboat in Cavite bay. A boat with no armed force put from the shore . The soldiers hailed the natives who refused to respond. A volley was fired killing one native and wounding another. Aguinaldo denies any connection with the affairs. These fights show the sullen disposition of the natives: It is feared there will be frequent bitter uprisings. Dewey has transferred the flag from the Olympia to [illegible] more as the former is going to Hong Kong to have her decks cleaned. 

Amagánzatt L.T- The troopship Prarie [sic] having aboard several hundred sick and wounded soldiers of the Massachusetts volunteers went ashore last night two miles from Montauk. No lives have been lost as far as known although the shock to the injured and wounded must have been of the most severest kind, That the accident was not attended  by more serious results is due to the prompt action of the life savers. Wheeler at Montauk, was notified. This morning the steamer was hard and fast on the beach, her position is udhanged [sic] from last night lighters are on the way to relieve her of troops. 

New York, Aug 26- Alex Scott the lightweight pugilist who fought with Tommy Butler at Green Athletic Club, Brooklyn last night was taken from the ring unconscious, died at the Norwweigan [sic] hospital this morning, never regaining consciousness . Scotts death was peculiar; he was trained and in no condition to enter the right, but put up a good fight until the last few rounds when he utterly collapsed. The principles were arrested and held pending an investigation.  

Santiago, Aug. 26 the Spanish transports, San Francisco, Sanuagustin and the [illegible] left yesterday with forty five hundred sixty eight Spanish including fifteen officer’s families, and four Priests. Eight persons died on the ships. Their corpses were checked off as passengers. It appears that many instances of this kind have occurred during the embarkation of the Spaniards, the transportation company thus being able to collect passage money, the matter being easily managed under the easy inspection of the Americans. General Toral made a short speech, a farewell to the soldiers. Shafter and his staff sailed this afternoon on the transport Mexico for the United States.

## Rich Men in Kansas. 
**Every Town Has One Who is Measured by Local Standard.**

There are no rich men in Kansas towns. The men who own million dollars’ worth of property number less than half a score in the whole state says Atlantic. Those who number half a million dollars’ worth of property might ride together in a sleeping car, with an upper berth or one to spare. Every town has its rich men measured by a local standard, who is frequently a retired farmer turned banker, but not one in five is rated at $100,000. Yet each is the autocrat of his county. if he cares to be. The mainspring that moves the town’s daily machinery may be found in the back room of the bank. There it is decided whether or not the bonds shall be voted. There it is often determined whether there shall be eight or nine months of school. There the village chronicles are spread upon the great ledgers every day. The town banker supplies the money for every contest. If he is wise, he watches his little corner of the world as a spider watches from his web. The great trust which he keeps requires a knowledge of the details of the game that men are playing around him. Yet with all his power this  [illegible] banker would be counted a poor [illegible] in the city. Seldom is [illegible] as $10,000. But he lives in the best house in the town. The butcher saves his best cuts for them, the grocer puts aside his best vegetables for him, and the whole town waits to do his bidding. 

## Language of Jewelry
**Symbolism is Carried Into Articles for Female adornments**

Human fancy, which looks for symbolic meaning in everything has found the proper symbolism of jewelry.  It is said, remarks the Philadelphia Record, that in making a present of jewelry the first matter to be considered is the color of the hair of the recipient. It is supposed that brunettes possess mainly positive qualities as intelligence, discretion, etc., while the blonds believed to be more lively and ideally inclined.  Since silver symbolizes fancy and enthusiasm it should prevail in the jewelry of dark-haired persons, for thus they receive what they lack- poetry and idealism. In the jewelry blonds, however, gold should be predominant, for this metal with dampen their vivacity and weaken their fancy. 

Of the gems rubies and garnets are considered the symbols for wisdom and good common sense, and are, therefore, it gifts for blonds. Other gems best suited for light-haired beauties are the topaz, the turquoise, and the sapphire. Brunettes should be presented with the amethyst, the stone of hope or the emerald. 	

The king of gems, the diamond is the symbol for elegance. It suits all the blond and the brunette. Pearls symbolize tears in popular superstition, and brides particularly should not wear these gems of the sea for the wearing of them at the wedding indicates the coming of tearful days.  

## HALIFAX FORT STRENGTHENED
**British Military Authorities Making Important Changes There**

In a quiet way the British military authorities are strengthening the station at Halifax N.S.   The imperial troops in the garrison there are to be increased by the addition of 600 royal artillerymen, making the total 1,000. It is probable that the royal Berkshire regiment will be sent direct to England from Halifax instead of to Bermuda as intended.  

Plans have been made for a new quick firing battery to be constructed at Point Pleasant by the imperial authorities. Out of the sum voted by the imperial government for Halifax an amount will be taken to erect a commodious stable as it is the intention of the military authorities to place here two or more batteries of royal horse artillery. The horses will be purchased at Halifax, but the guns and all equipments [sic] will be sent from England. It is also stated that next summer a quick-firing battery will be constructed on George’s island. The guns will be of very latest pattern. Another powerful searchlight in addition to the one proposed for Sleepy cove is to be  erected in a prominent position  near the entrance to the harbor.  

## THE FLYING BICYCLE
**Aerial Wheel Will Never Be Realized Says Maxim.**

Suggestions of a flying bicycle have been numerous in recent years but, Hiram Maxim, of Maxim gun fame, gives cold encouragement to the ambitious wheeler who would rise with the lark and while away his leisure in midair.

It will never be possible for a man to drive the flying machine with his feet, Mr. Maxim told an interviewer the other day, because the power a man can develop in this way is so small,  in comparison with the weight of the [illegible] added to his own weight.

Though a man may work up to one horsepower for a few seconds, Mr. Maxim explains, in order to fly he would have to work up to and maintain two or three horsepower, and his machine, moreover, must be of practically no weight at all.  A man would require two or three horsepower to lift his own weight, and a machine of any weight would require increased power in proportion.

On the whole, this assurance of Mr. Maxim’s will probably be received with consolation  rather than disappoint, to cycledom.   

## Just the place for a Barn. 

An old Sussex farmer visiting London for the first time was taken into St. Paul’s Cathedral.  He stared about him in amazement, and his astonishment at the magnitude of the building seemed too great for utterance.  It was only when he stood under the dome and gazed down the vast n[illegible] and [illegible] the dim and misty roof that his admiration at last found vent in words: “[illegible] what a [illegible] this?
