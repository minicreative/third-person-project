**SHOWN BY THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE NAVAL COURT OF INQUIRY**  
**The Situation Looks Grave.**  
**Spanish Government Holds the Disaster of Internal Origin – War Preparations on an Unprecedent [sic] Scale Hurried to Completion.**  

Washington, March 25 – The Court of Inquiry appointed to investigate the cause of the Maine disaster has reported that the loss of the battleship was due to an oneside [sic] explosion.

The State Department by direction of the President has cabled United States Minister Woodford at Madrid to notify the Spanish Government of this conclusion.

**A Grave Situation.**

The President and cabinet advisers held two extended sessions today one at 10:30 a.m., and another at 3:30 p.m., at which the report was considered in detail. Members of the cabinet stated after the meeting that the discission [sic] was of a grave character and that never since the wrecking of the Maine had the situation seemed so critical.

The Spanish Government has cabled officially to Washington that the Spanish naval commission holds the disaster to the Maine to be of internal origin.

The Government of Spain, it can be stated positively, is not disposed to turn back the torpedo flotilla now proceeding from the Canaries, and would be disinclined to consider a suggestion from this Government tending to interfere with the disposition by Spain of her own naval forces.

War preparations on an unpsecedented [sic] scale are being hurried to completion by the War and Navy Departments, and the country, practically is on a war footing.

The foregoing gives a record of one of the most eventful days the national capital has seen since the close of the civil war. It was a day of profoundly important action, of deepest anxiety, coupled with naval and military activity, one step following another in rapid succession. Representative men of the administration, public men in all branches of official and Congressional life, no less than the public in general, shared in the tension to which the situation has been wrought. There was no effort among the highest officials, nor indeed was possible, from what was clearly apparent in the developments of the day, to minimize the situations.

## Finding of the Court of Inquiry.

Viewed in detail the finding of the Court of Inquiry was the most vital feature. Commander Marix, Judge-Advocate of the Court of Inquiry, delivered the report to Secretary Long early this mornisg [sic] and shortly after it was carried to the White House and placed in the hands of the President.

At 10:30 the cabinet assembled, half an hour earlier than usual and began the consideration of the momentous document. Even the rigid rules of secrecy which prevail at cabinet meetings were made doubly strict in this case, and no intimation of the results reached by the court were known until 4 o’clock, when an Associated Press bulletin gave the information to the country as well as the eagerly waiting officials throughout Washington. These results, briefly stated, are that the loss of the Maine was due to an explosion from the outside, the court being unable to fix the responsibility for the explosion. The court does not express an opinion as to the character of the explosion, but the testimoney [sic] goes to show that it was a powerful submarine mine, the exact character of which is not determined by the testimony, though the belief was expressed that it was a floating submarine mine. There were two explosions, the court finds the fires from the outside, and that set off one of the smaller magazines.

It was the result, expressed in detail and with the precision of a court deeply concious [sic] of its responsibility, together with the evidence on which it was based, that occupied the attention of the cabinet throughout its extended session this morning and afternoon. The other and lesser subjects gave way to this foremost question. There was no change in the plan of making the report public and transmitting it to Congress early next week, accompanied by a brief message from the President.

While interest was thus centered at the White House, the Navy and War Departments were hurrying forward their work of preparations.

## The Cape Fear Squadron.

For the benefit of those citizens who are fearful that the “wily Spaniards” may slip into Wilmington and do mischief, we will say that the “Cape Fear Squadron” is in splendid trim and can withstand some pretty good shocks (from tar barrels). The flag-ship, Driver, has had her bottom scraped and a few extra planks put in her gun deck. The torpedo boat destroyer [sic], Croesus was coaling (with wood) yesterday preparatory to going out to sea, (up the river) to plant mines (or rice, we failed to learn which). The armored battleship, Imperial, with several barges of ammunition (wood) in tow, passed Fort Point Peter, this morning enroute to Horse Shoe bend where the government (State) has fortified a rice field and placed there in a garrison of convicts. The other war ships in the harbor are making preparations for active service, and an old sea dog told us yesterday that the fleet now in port, under Commodore, David Sasser, is the most formidable on the Atlantic sea board. No Spaniards can enter this port.

## Those Letters.

Below is the full text of the letter which caused the alleged rumpus and upon which Mr. Chadbourn decided not to appoint Mr. Howe in the postoffice to any place whatever. The facts as contained in this letter are apparent to every voter in New Hanover county who believes in honest dealing.

Letter No. 2  
Wilmington, N.C.  
Feb’y 14, 1898  

**Personal**  
Hon. J.C. Pritchard, U.S.S.,  

Dear Senator: – Enclosed find clippings from the “Messenger” and “Star,” our morning dailies, from an an [sic] interview with Mr. W.H. Chadbourn, P.M. at this place on Thursday last.

Now, Senator, in order to effect a compromise agreeable to you and Col. Boyd, my friends, on the promise that you would see that Chadbourn carried out his part of the agreement, consented to withdraw the claims of Mr. Albright for P.M. and then they asked that I be appointed Asst. PM. which request I sent to you, and which has been presented to Mr. Chadbourn, but directly Mr. C. took possession of the office he declined to make the appointment, alleging that it would be impolitic, as there is a white lady in there protected by Mr. Cleveland’s civil service who would resign her position as money order clerk, although that lady has not, nor ever has had a single vote under her control that can aid the Republican party. Mr. Albright suggested to Mr. Chadbourn by the way of harmony that I be designated as Asst. P.M. with the salary thereof and placed in the charge of the mailing department where I would not come in contact this lady, [illegible] clerk’s place which is sor[illegible] man with some mailing duties attached. Is this fair? Is it just? Does it savor of harmony?

In 1896 with a promise from our leaders that the colored men should have the bulk of the federal patronage, the colored men of New Hanover county with 45 delegates out of a possible 54 yielded up everything, and are now told that it won’t do to appoint us to the only position not covered by civil service. If this state of affairs prevails, then we are forced to the alternative of this year placing Negroes in nomination for every office in this County and electing them with our black majority of 1,000. You can readily see what effect this would have on the State, but we will be literally forced into it, since at the hands of the government we receive nothing of a fiduciary character.

We would fain see some other way out of this for the party’s good, but these are the conditions that confront us.

Mr. Dancy comes here as collector which is a recognition of the Negroes from the other parts of the State. Mr. Rice goes in as his deputy, into the only place not covered by the classified service. Mr. Chadbourn refuses to give me the only place under him not in the classified service; what then are the 3,800 Negroes of New Hanover to get?

You promised to go Mr. Chadbourn’s bond for his keeping faith with your friends, will you leave them now to his tender(?) mercies?

This letter is written after mature deliberation with my friends, who are your friends.

Very truly and sincerely,  
Jno. Thos. Howe.

## INTENSE EXCITEMENT
**Lighthouse Tender Mangrove Dispached  [sic] to Havana.**  
**For the American Officials.**
**All, With the Exception of Consul General Lee – Rear Admiral Sicard’s Views of the Naval Court Inquiry.**  

[Indecipherable] March 25. – The Associated Press bulletin that the Court of Inquiry had found the Maine was blown up by submarine mine created intense excitement here.

The most significant development that followed the announcement of the court’s report—a development known to but few—was the sudden sailing of the lighthouse tender, Mangrove for Havana. The Mangrove was lying quietly at the dock, loading buoy, when orders came about 5 o’clock this afternoon for her to proceed with all haste to Havana and take on board all the American officials in that city with the exception Consul General Lee.

It is feared here that the knowledge of the court’s report has excited Havana’s population, and brought the anti-American sentiment to a climax. Officers of high rank were still reticent. [illegible]

Read Admiral Sicard, however, said, “The Court of Inquiry brought in findings according to what its members believed. Nothing could have made them do otherwise. If they had been able to fix the responsibility, I feel sure they would not have shirked this duty.”

The attention of Rear Admiral Sicard was drawn to the fact that Spain had officially denied that Havana harbor was mined. He replied “If Havana harbor were mine, I should certainly have mined it. The water there is especially suitable to such a method of defence. Spain’s denial had nothing to do with the Court of Inquiry. I should not believe a statement that Havana harbor was not mined.

The court has not yet been dissolved. It is barely possible that more work may be required of it; but this is not probable. “The Court of Inquiry is composed of splendid men.  I am greatly satisfied with their work. I hardly suppose much excitement will be caused by the announcement of the verdict, as I am under the impression that 99 per cent of our own people were convinced that the Maine was blown up externally; and I scarcely think their ideas would have changed even if the court had reported otherwise.”

When the possibility of arbitration and ensuing entanglement were suggested to him, Rear Admiral Sicard said: “The Maine case is nothing in comparison with the Alabama claims. Then we were opposed to a powerful commercial rival; but now we are dealing with Spain.”

Washington, March, 25. – At the White House it was said that official advices here did not bear out the suggestion of a pending crisis in Havana, and that there were no dispatches from General Lee of a disquieting nature. As to the movement of the Mangrove it was said that her departure was merely in line with orders issued days ago, to go to Havana and return with the remaining officers of the Maine now there.

## Political History

**Chapter V**

As stated yesterday, Mr. C. D. Lockey was promised the City Attorneyship but for the job did not materialize, nor has any reference to his appointment been made since.

Several prominent and intelligent Republicans made application to the several officials for places under the new administration, and when the County Commissioners met Dec. 7th for the purpose of adjusting the offices, the several applications were not referred to, but others were elected who have never amounted to anything politically, and as to their Republicanism they were not even known, while those who were known to be life-long Republicans were completely ignored. It was at this time that [ ] Bellamay [sic], Esq., Democrat [ ] elected County Attorney [ ] Standard [ ] Keeper of the [ ] Galloway, [ ] Committee, [ ]. The last [ ] for [ ] by the commissioners for a [illegible]tion under that body.

The colored vote is about 95 percent of the total Republican vote of New Hanover County, but less than 20 percent of offices directly in the hands of the County Commissioners were given them. Those of the colored men who made application were assured beforehand that they would receive proper attention but when it came to a vote their names were not mentioned, and only those elected were placed in nomination.

The reason given for this action was that under the Federal government the colored voters would be cared for, thus throwing the Negro off their hands and upon the hands of the National Government, although every office was under civil service except a few insignificant ones.

The only appointment of note under the County administration made to a colored man, was the office of Deputy Register of Deeds made by C.W. Norwood, Esq. himself a colored man, and not a caucus nominee at that.

(Yesterday we stated that the Convention was held in May 1898. This should have been May 1896 and instead of Mr. Rice being from the Fourth ward he was from the Fifth)

## [Untitled]
The recent decision of Justice Harlan of the Supreme Court, involving the liability of an insurance company upon policies held by a man who in sound mind deliberately commits suicide, is now published in full and is regarded as of the greatest importance, writes William E. Curtis in the Chicago Record. A man by the name of Runk had policies to the extent of $315,000 until a short time before his death, when he increased his insurance to $1500.00. He held an important judiciary trust, to which he had been unfaithful, and, being afraid of exposure and the same time remorseful, obtained insurance to an amount sufficient to reimburse those who would suffer by his defalcation and provide for the necessities of his family, whereupon he deliberately took his own life. Some of the insurance companies resisted payment, went into court, and the case was finally appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that if, from anger, pride, jealousy, or a desire to escape from the ills of life, a man intentionally takes his own life, there is no liability on the part of the insurance companies to pay the risks, because such an act is a violation of the condition under which policy is issued. But when a man’s reasoning faculties are so impaired that he is not able to understand his moral obligations and appreciate the consequences of the act he is about to commit, such a death is not a violation of the contract, and the insurance is liable. In the Runk case it was perfectly clear that the suicide had a full and accurate comprehension of the character and the consequences of his act, and that it was a willful attempt to transfer his own obligations to innocent parties. This suicide is compared with the crime of arson, in which a man intentionally may set fire to his own house in order to recover its value from the insurers.

**The Mercury’s Plaint.**  

I don’t know why I’m slandered so,  
If I go high – if I go low --  
There’s always some one who will say,  
”Just see that mercury today!”  
'And whether toward the top I crawl  
Or down toward zero I may fall.  
They always fret, and say that I  
Am far too low or far too high.  
And though I try with all my might  
I never seem to strike it right.  
Now I admit it seems to me  
They show great inconsistency.  
But they imply I am to blame,  
Of course that makes my anger flame,  
And in a fiery fit of pique  
I stay at ninety for a week.  
Or sometimes in a dull despair,  
I give them just a frigid stare;  
And as upon their taunts I think  
My spirits down to zero sink.  
Mine is indeed a hopeless case --  
To try to please the human race!

## Hawthorne’s Bear Story.

In “Hawthorne’s First Diary,” begun at his home in Raymond, Maine, when he was a small boy, he tells a bear story, which is vouched for by his editor. Hawthorne gives it as follows:

Mr. Henry Turner of Otisfield took his axe and went out between Saturday and Moose ponds, to look at some pine trees. A rain had just taken off enough of the snow to lay bare the roots of a part of the trees. Under a large root there seemed to be a cavity, and on examining closely, something was exposed very much like long black hair.

He cut off the root, saw the nose of a bear, and killed him, pulled out the body, saw another, killed that, and dragged out the carcass, when he found that there was a third one in the den, and that he was thoroughly awake too; but as soon as the head came in sight, it was split open with the axe, so that Mr. Turner alone, with only an axe, killed three bears in less than half an hour, the youngest being a good-sized one, and what the hunters call a yearling.

This is a pretty good bear story, but probably true, and happened only a few weeks ago; for John Patch, who was here with his father, Captain Levi. Len Patch, who lives within two miles of the Saturday pond, told me so yesterday.

*[ This story can be found here: [Hawthorne's First Diary: With an Account of Its Discovery and Loss](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAmmGtQ9xAQC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=Hawthorne%E2%80%99s+Bear+Story.%22&source=bl&ots=IAxX9--bpy&sig=ACfU3U1h94rbHbDdiOUH9fDq7G9VE2O-fw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2-ungvanmAhVMh-AKHT41CnoQ6AEwCXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=Hawthorne%E2%80%99s%20Bear%20Story.%22&f=false) ]*



## [Indecipherable]  
“O—o!” cried Kittie, running into the barn. “Oh, dear,  am so scared.!”

Jack was making willow whistles, but he looked up.

“What’s the matter?” he asked.

“Oh!” said Kittie, again, “I was coming across the cornfield, and there was a horrid man there and he tried to catch me.”

“A man?’ said Jack.

“Oh, yes. A great horrid ugly man like a tramp, and all in rags.”

“Don’t you be frightened, Kittie,” said Jack, who was a brave little fellow. Father and George are over in the east meadow getting the hay, but I’m here, and I’ll go and see what he wants.”

Kittie begged him not to, for fear the man might hurt him, but Jack said stoutly:

“He might be after the chickens or the new calf, and I must look after things when father is not here. I’ll take Towser.”

He whistled to Towser, and ran off to the cornfield. Kittie was afraid to stay alone, and so she followed him, but at a safe distance. Baby Dick trotted at her heels. Just as they were getting under the fence they heard a ringing shout from Jack, who was in the middle of the field; and when they came in sight, they found him shaking the arm of the “tramp.”

“Oh, Kit, you goose!” he cried. “It’s only a scarecrow George made yesterday to keep the birds away from the corn.”

“Why,” said Baby Dick, “he’s nuthin but a drate big dolly.”

“Yes, that’s what he is,” said Jack. “He’s George’s doll.”

George’s doll stood in the field all summer, and the children went often to see him.

And so, when things frighten, you, if you can only be brave, like little Jack, and go right up and look at them, you will very often find them only scarecrows.

## Milly’s Rudeness.

Milly had to get her lessons ready for the morrow. She was always supported by her schoolmistress to spend an hour over this work. As a rule, Milly’s mother sat with her to give her a little help from time to time, but that afternoon she was too busy; so she left her little girl, telling her to do her lessons well while she was away.

But Milly found it was very hard to do as her mother told her. It was so hot she felt as if she could not think. Then she thought it was just the sort of a day when it would have been nice to sit in the garden under the trees and read her new story book. Instead of that she had to be at work in the library! It was really almost more than she could stand without growing as cross as a little girl could very well be.

It was true that, once the hour was over and tea finished, she would be able to go into the garden and enjoy herself as much as she pleased. But that was just the tiresome part. The hour would not pass. She sat with her face to the clock, for she thought then she should be able to see how the time went, and that would help her to work; but she felt very helpless over it all.

She had to find all the capitals of Europe, and mark them upon her map, and learn their names by heart. There was Athens, which would not be found. If the geography book had not stated so decidedly that it was in Greece, Milly would have felt quite sure that it must be in some other country. She supposed, however, that the man who wrote the geography book was right; after coming to which opinion she looked at the clock and sighed. Five minutes past four, and she had to work till five!

She fell to hunting once more for Athens. It seemed to her a very long time that she had been wandering over that corner of Europe known as Greece, when she again glanced at the clock. Seven minutes past four. Only seven minutes past four! And she had thought at least ten minutes must have passed.

She began her search for Athens once more. At last she found it, and then she looked at the clock anew. Three minutes more had passed, that was all. Milly stamped her foot angrily. “It is too horrid!” she said aloud, as if speaking to the bronze man who held up the clock. “The time will never go!”

She glanced listlessly at her lesson book. She could not remember the names of those stupid capitals at all. They went out of her head as quietly as she found them on the map. Why did countries want capitals? Only to make another horrid hard lesson for little boys and girls. That was all; she was sure of it.

Milly drummed her fingers on the table for a few moments after setting this point and gazed wearily at the clock. Then she took a resolve. She would be a wise, good girl. She would read the names of the capitals ten times over without stopping and never look at the clock once until she had done. Depend upon it, when she had finished her task, ever so much time would have passed.

She started. Once – twice – three – faster – faster – faster – did she read over the names of those capitals which always managed to escape her. By the time that she was going over them for the tenth time her speed was almost equal to that of an express train.

Then she looked at the clock again. She did so with a delightful feeling of hope. More than hope; she felt sure that the hands must have move on long way. She looked and looked again, and then she sat and stared with grief and anger.

O bad, untrustworthy clock-its hands had barely moved on five minutes!

Barely five minutes! Impossible! It must have stopped. Yes, that was the reason it showed so little progress. There was but little doubt. 

Milly crossed the room her ear close to the clock, she listened hopefully. Alas! Alas! It had been wrongfully accused. It was doing its duty faithfully. Tick – tick – tick – it was going as fast as its works and time would allow it to.

The hour would never pass – never – never – never! Milly sat on the hearth-rug and burst into tears. It was just at that moment that her mother came into the library.

“Why, Milly, child, what is wrong?” she asked, raising her from the floor and kissing her.

“The time won’t go,” she sobbed, “and I am so tired of doing lessons!”

“Where have you been working?” said her mother. “Oh, I see,” she added, as she glanced at the books on the table. “I see,” she repeated, then added, “Now I want you to be very rude.”

“Very rude!” Milly said with surprise. “Why, you are always very angry when I am rude.”

“Yes, but I want you to be so now,” her mother said, smiling. “You know I have often told you that it is not polite to turn your back upon anyone, but I wish you to do so now. I wish you to turn your back upon bronze gentleman who holds the clock. I think that you will work so much better and the time will go much faster.”

So Milly did as her mother wished, and she was quite surprised when tea-time came and the hour was over.

“It really was very, very funny, mother,” she said. “The time went so slowly at first, and so quickly after! It must have been because when I began I had my face to the clock and afterward I had my back to it.”

“That was it,” replied her mother. “And if one is feeling idle, and more inclined for play than lessons, it is much better to work with one’s back to the clock. It is wonderful how it shortens the time. – Youth’s Companion.

## Birds Made to Order
The Japanese are ruthless in their tampering with nature. If they decide that they want a bird or an animal of a certain shape or color they set about manufacturing the article, so to speak, by the exercise of exceedingly clever ingenuity and untiring patience. Here, for example, is how the white sparrows are produced. They select a pair of grayish birds and keep them in a white cage in a white room, where they are attended by a person dressed in white. The mental effect on a series of generations of birds results in completely white birds. – Rural World.

Housekeepers who cook dried fruit properly prepare it by washing it thoroughly, letting it soak in cold water until all dirt or sediment has been loosened and washed off, then rinse it thoroughly and put it to soak for twenty-four hours in clear water. Cook it slowly and not very long in the water in which it has been soaked. This process brings out the real fresh fruit flavor better than any other.

**Boiled Cabbage.**
Pick of all the dead outside leaves, cut the cabbage in half, cut off the stalk, and wash thoroughly in cold water, and then put in a collander [sic]; when drained put into plenty of fast boiling water with a heaped tablespoonful of salt and a tiny piece of soda; keep the saucepan uncovered and let boil gently until quite tender; the instant it is done take up into a colander, place a plate over it, let it thoroughly drain and serve. Tie a [indecipherable] of crumb of bread in a piece of [ ], put it in the saucepan with the cabbage, and it will prevent the unpleasant odor while boiling.

**Chestnut Cream.**
Boil two pounds of chestnut, and after removing the skins and husks boil them again in a pint of milk, sweetened with two ounces of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract; when passed through a wire sieve this should measure a pint; now mix two wineglassfuls of lemon or cherry juice with it, instead of the maraschino, as given in the recipe; melt two ounces of gelatin in a saucepan containing a teacup of cold water; whip up a pint of cream and mix it carefully and lightly with the chestnut puree and stir in the melted gelatine [sic] when a little cool; if cold the gelatine[sic] will make the cream lumpy; if too hot it will destroy the lightness of the cream; turn it into molds; if they are small individual glass molds [ ] fancy shapes it is a prettier way of serving the cream than by turning it [ ] large mold and cutting it in [ ]; when it becomes very cold pass the mold quickly through warm water, wipe dry and reverse it on a glass dish; surround with a border of lemon jelly; an individual mold dot with bits of jelly. – Chicago Record.

**Household Hints.**
Cold eggs froth most readily,  
Butter for cake should not be melted,  
The ingredients for pastry must be very cold.  
Nutmegs should be grated at the blossom end first.  
Cut warm bread and cake with a knife heated by being placed in boiling [indecipherable] [illegible] bowls have a [illegible] and are accompanied with silver servers.  
Add a spoonful of vinegar to the water in which meat or fowls are boiled to make them tender.  
A little vinegar kept boiling in the stove while onions and cabbage are cooking will prevent the spread of the disagreeable odor.  
If a piece of rare beesteak [sic] is left over from breakfast, it makes an excellent sandwich filling for luncheon, if chopped very fine and seasoned with salt and pepper. In this condition it is much more digestible than when reheated in the universally detested stew.  
Cut glass, bound with sterling silver is a popular combination now for a table service, and is recommended for bowls and platters in which silver forks or spoons must be placed, for the contact of the metal with the cut edges frequently results in chips or cracks.  
White stains on furniture may be removed by rubbing with hot milk and turpentine, oil and turpentine, or even kerosene. Dark stains on wood yield to oxalic acid. To prepare this, fill a bottle full of crystals, and then fill up with water. Keep the bottle labeled and on a high shelf out of the reach of children.  
To the large consumption of watercress in the city of London, says a medical authority, may be attributed the high standard of health in that city. Carefully washed and picked over, lightly sprinkled with salt and eaten with thin slices of bread and butter, it affords the best possible appetizer for breakfast.  
Chicken and other small pieces of meat should either be thoroughly rolled in flour or dipped in beaten egg and rolled in dry crumbs. Southern cooks, who are renowned for their fried chicken always use lard for frying, cooking them as quickly as possible. The same is true of crabs – the fat should be very hot, and they should be turned often to avoid burning.  

## Parisian Art.
When a lady is sitting to a Parisian photographer for a portrait the operator does not in a perfunctory manner, coldly request her to look pleasant, if you please. He says to her in the most natural and graceful manner in the world: “It is quite unnecessary to ask madam to look pleasant; she could not look otherwise.” The lady, of course, acknowledges the compliment with her most gracious and high-bred smile. “Click!” goes the camera and the picture is obtained, revealing the sitter to the greatest possible advantage.

## For Woman’s Benefit

**Earrings.**  
Earrings may be worn with a theatre toque. They may be worn with a small hat, and they may be worn with a hat that is set over the face. The best authorities agree that earrings do not look well when the hat is back on the head. They give an Oriental appearance that is not pleasing. The small screws may be worn with the big hats, but never the big hoops. Very large hoops, on the other hand, often look well with the very small hat, and for theatre wear are often both decorative and effective.

**Tartan Traveling Wraps.**  
From Scotland comes pretty tartan travelling wraps, fringed like the old-fashioned shawls. For steamers these warm woolen garments are particularly comfortable. One made of reversible cloth, green underneath and a Gordon plaid above, has two capes, the top one reaching below the shoulders about to the elbow, and the other well below the hips; these are held in place by a plait in the back, which has a ribbon tacked on at the waist, which, holding it tight to the figure, adds greatly to the warmth of the cape. Over the shoulders is a hood large enough to cover any hat, and the high storm collar reaches, when turned up, well above the ears.

**Lace in Vogue.**
Lace has not been so much in vogue for many years, and lace collars and cuffs, also frills, will be worn more than ever this coming season. As a rule, the men of today care little for laces, but they appeal to every woman. Manners and customs have changed since the seventeenth century, for at that period men wore more lace than the women, and the severity of Henry XIV’s prime minister in prohibiting the use of lace may be understood in the fact that De Cinq-Mars left at his death in 1642 more than 300 sets of lace collars and cuffs. Louis XIV had a passion for lace, and amassed a large collection. During the reign of Louis XV a room was not complete without elaborate lace coverlets and bed linen of all kinds trimmed with lace. The Dowager Duchess de la Ferte had a huge coverlet made of one single piece of Venetian point, valued at $14,000.

**Mittens without Thumbs.**
For generations doting mothers and impatient nurses have sat with wiggling infants (who must needs have an airing, though the thermometer registers 40 below freezing point) on their knees, using their best endeavors to crowd baby’s refractory thumbs into the place where the thumb ought to go, knowing full well all the time that no sooner would the ungrateful offspring be tucked away in his carriage than by hook or crook he would manage to work the little member free, and ten chances to one lose his mitten in the process.

But not until this end of the century has there arisen a woman clever enough to hit upon the perfectly obvious improvement of thumbless mittens for baby. Only the experienced can realize how it simplifies matters to slip the little hand into a case that just fits it, without any superfluous arrangement for the tiny thumb.

In knitting these mittens one has simply to shape them to the little hand as it lies flat, the thumb lying alongside the forefinger.

Some prefer them knitted with wrists that extend half way to the elbow.

**Mrs. Burnett’s Admires.**
Scarcely ever does the post arrive at the home of Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett without bringing her letters from unknown friends in the most remote corners of the earth.

Among the many came one not long ago of peculiar interest and charm from the wife of a rector in a little Devonshire village. She wrote simply to say that she had been reading aloud the story of “Two Little Pilgrims’ Progress” at her “mothers’ meetings,” and that she could not be quite happy until she had told its author how deep its tender human sympathy had sunk into the mother heart of her audience.

So absorbing was their interest that if by chance one of them was kept from the meeting by illness or some unexpected household emergency, a more fortunate woman volunteered to go to her home and relate the lost portion of the story, thus practically illustrating its beautiful moral, “No one is so poor but that he has something to give to somebody.”

So intimate and real did the experience of the little wayfarers seem to these hard worked, self denying women that they computed with the greatest care just how long the hard-boiled eggs would hold out, and the home of the little cripple appealed to them as a too familiar picture from their own lives.

Mrs. Burnett is never too busy – even when absorbed in writing a novel or play – to turn aside from her exacting labor and respond to any sincere human voice. In this case she not only wrote a long and interesting personal letter, but sent her photograph, with the inscription: “To the mothers’ meeting at Upton Pyne. Frances Hodgson Burnett.”

**Working Their Way.**
Of the 300 students who are digging away at the University of Chicago about half are said to be “working through.” The different means by which they accomplish this end are almost numerous and varied as the girls themselves – or the causes which prompt them to enter the struggle for a living and college education at one and the same time.

Sometimes the experiment is made with the object of gaining experience or variety of student life in view, occasionally it is begun from the mere love of adventure, or in a spirit of bravado arising from the intense desire to show some person or persons that the average college girl, attempting it, is quite capable of looking after herself. Most often, of course, outside work is necessary for the successful knotting of the proverbial ends which so frequently refuse to meet. When a girl secures a chance to do some of the coveted “university service” work this is always the case. A student must have been working at the university for at least one quarter before work of this kind is given her, and her application for it must be signed by one of the professors under whom she is laboring. And the cases in which she is given sufficient work to pay for her entire tuition are rare indeed; there have been less than a dozen of such instances during the entire life of the university up to the present time.

The “university service” is a sort of business bureau or exchange over which Dr. T.W. Goodspeed presides, and which looks after this matter of assistance through employment, both for the men and women of the colleges. Some 60 or 70 students can be given work in the course of every quarter, and to the lot of the young women fall nearly all of the lighter and less arduous services.

The “faculty exchange,” which is really an office for the members of the faculty, claims the assistance of one girl for every hour of the day. Work in the general and departmental libraries is apportioned in the same manner. Office work, stenographic work, secretaryships for the various deans, together with some work in the editoral department of the university, furnishing other means of employment for the young women who have more learning than either. Until the present year women have sung in the chapel choir as well as men, thus giving credit on their tuition bills. Several of the feminine students also play for the gymnasium classes, and in this manner earn one-third, one-half or two-thirds of their tuition. The latter amount is the total allowed by the laws of the university, and the scale of payment is by no means high, according to many of the students who benefit by the work. The services are light, in no case requiring more than two hours of daily attention, but time is more than money to the ambitious student, who must accomplish a great deal in the shortest possible period, and the sacrifice of two hours of every day is anything but light. But the work is eagerly sought after, in spite of all its drawbacks, and there is never enough of it to allow all the applications to be granted.

## Electric [Indecipherable]
**Harnessing [ ] Mighty Force For [Farmer’s] Benefit.**  
Electrifying the Earth and Stimulating the Germination of Seeds by Subjecting Them to Electrical Treatment – Growing Vegetables by Electrical Process

Since electricity became a science various efforts have been made to determine what effect, if any, it has upon the growth of plants and vegetables. Many heated discussions have attended the tests by those who have entertained opposite theories, and [it is] therefore particularly interesting [to] know that the experiments carried [on] for some time past at the Government Agricultural station at Amherst, Mass., indicate that the use of electricity by the farmer is a distinct stimulus to nature and exerts a marked influence upon the germination of seeds and the growth of farm produce.

The ABC of the scientists’ argument in favor of the use of electricity on the farm is that roaming around loose in the atmosphere there is a vast fund of electrical force, which, by means of specially devised apparatus, can be attracted to earth and distributed through the ground in which the farmer has sown his seed. The apparatus by means of which the electricity is caught and harnessed for the use of the farmer has been thoroughly tested at Amherst and has proved to be a complete success. Briefly described, it consists of a number of copper spikes, which are elevated at the top of a 50-foot pole. These spikes gather the electric fluid and convey it to the foot of the pole, where it is caught by wires buried a few feet beneath the ground and distributed over as much of the earth as the farmer desires. So much electricity is there wandering around loose in the atmosphere that one of these poles can catch and distribute enough to electrify several acres of ground.

With this apparatus experiments have been made which may be summarized as follows: After seeds had been subjected to the electric treatment [for] a period of twenty-four hours, it was found that over 30 percent more seeds were germinated by the aid of electricity than in a like quantity of seeds sown in ground that lacked the electrical stimulant. As the scientists in charge of the experiments wished to make a very complete test, the electric current was applied to seeds that were allowed to stay in the ground for forty-eight hours. It was found that 2[ ] percent more seeds had germinated in the electrified ground than in the soil where the seeds had been left to sprout under normal conditions, and in seventy-two hours this percentage had dropped to six, thus showing that the use of the current for the purpose of stimulating germination under all the tests was a decided success.

Another interesting experiment was made by planting in two sections of ground, the soil in both of which had been carefully selected to ensure it being exactly alike, seeds of the following varieties: Parsnips, lettuce, carrot, turnip, radish and onion. [ ] section of ground a mild [current of] electricity was applied to the [ ] day the plants [ ]. The rapidity of the[ ] those planted in the electric [prepared] ground was far in advance [of] those planted in the ordinary [ground]. The second day plants broke [through] the surface in both plots, those [in the] electric garden showing [considerably] the more rapid growth; the [foliage] was rank, and when harvested was nearly twice as high as that of the non-electric plot. The roots were all larger, and showed a marked difference in favor of electricity. One peculiarity was that in the electric [plot] for every pound of roots very nearly [ ] pound of tops was produced, while in the other case for every pound of tops there grew 1.43 pounds of root, [ ] the difference in the total [was ] all [in ] favor of electricity. With [ ] to the other vegetables, the [report ] proved a failure in both plots. The carrots showed a marked superiority in the electric bed over those of the non-electric. The onion plants [ ] up in both beds and grew finely for a time, then blasted, and not one developed, either electric or non-electric, this being the only case of [ ] the vegetables tested where noticible results were obtained.

Next to the parsnips the [radishes ] gave the next best results [They] grew rapidly, those in the electric [garden] being always ahead. [The tops] were rank and the roots were [ ]. When the best of the radishes [of] each plot were pulled, washed and weighed, it was found that the six largest roots taken from the electric plot weighed two ounces more than the six largest taken from the non-electric plot. They were larger individually, the taproot longer, of a finer flavor, of better quality, more brittle and every way superior to those raised without the aid of electricity.

## Where Hearing Ceases
Lord Rayleigh in a recent lecture said that experiments had shown that a vibration of sound having an amplitude of less than one twelve-millionth of a centimeter could still affect the sense of hearing. Such a vibration would be so short that it would have to be enlarged one hundred times before the most powerful possible microscope could render it visible, supposing that it were susceptible of being seen at all. Old people, he said, do not hear high notes which are audible to young persons, and there is reason to believe that babies hear notes which are inaudible to their elders.

Chief Haddock of the bureau of building inspection, in Philadelphia, recommends that the height of buildings in that city be limited by law, and that none, even on the widest street, have a greater height than 150 feet. Otherwise, he says, the city’s narrow streets may become gloomy canyons, [unsanitary], with the light of day virtually shut out.

## Paradox in Canal Making
Irrigation in the western United States goes steadily and eagerly on, and the methods employed have in some instances, apparently at least, reversed the order of nature. To be more explicit, they have scaled the rest of the continent and propose to turn the waters of the Pacific slope into the watershed of the Atlantic. The point is to seek the head waters of those streams whose available supply has not already been fully appropriated for irrigation purposes, and turn certain portions of that supply backward and across the divide into a different watershed altogether, and add them to that already utilized in the system of irrigation.

To the uninitiated this might seem to be an impossible feat, yet in substance it has been accomplished, and the scheme is in successful operation. In northern Colorado the waters of [the] Big Laramie, which flow north[ward] into Wyoming and empty into [the] North Platte river have been [intercepted] high up in the Rocky Mountain [range] and [carried by] means of a [transalpine] ditch – [southward] across [the Medicine Bow mountains and poured into Chambers lake at the head] of the Cache la [Poudre] river, [whose], waters flow southeastward, [emptying] into the South Platte river [in eastern] Colorado. This feat was accomplished by the Water Supply and Storage company, owners of the Larimer County ditch, one of the largest irrigating systems in Colorado.

## An Ocean Trolley Line.
An ocean trolley line, which reaches nearly a quarter of a mile over the sea, conveying either passengers or merchandise, is one of the curious sights to be seen at Bear harbor, on the Pacific coast, not far from San Francisco. While the ostensible object of this strange trolley is the carrying of lumber from the rocky highland aboard the big schooners, which form the ocean terminus of the line, dozens of lumbermen ride in a basket attached to the suspended cable on a wheel.

Of course there is no electricity used in connection with this novel trolley. The power of gravity does most of the hard work. The lumber schooners come from the Mendocino county ports. Until a year ago they were loaded by the slow process of lighters plying to and from the wharfs. By the new trolley system lumber in any quantity can be carried from any island point over a long and high railroad bridge to a sort of cage, where the wooden cargoes are stacked, and thence to the deck of each ship. The trolley line is thrown from the lumber cage to the vessels by means of a rope shot from a mortar. Behind the rope trails the wire, which is quickly and securely attached to the vessel’s mast, after which the ocean trolley is ready for business.

## The Greatest Gold Nuggets.
The biggest gold nugget on record was found at Ballarat, Australia. It weighed 2218 ounces and was worth $41,000. Next comes a chunk of the yellow metal dug up at Berlin, New South Wales, valued at $30,340; it tipped the scales at 1770 ounces. Two Australian nuggets called the “Viscount Canterbury” and “Viscountess Canterbury,” weighing 1121 ounces and 884 ounces respectively, were appraised at $22,000 and $16,000. On one claim at Dunnolly two golden lumps weighing 538 ounces and 478 ounces, worth $10,000 and $9000, were picked up. Two other great Australian nuggets – all the biggest ones were discovered there – were found by Chinamen and were melted to the tune of $13,000 and $5000.

## Naval Militia Called On.

For the first time the militia was called into service, and the Governors of Massachusetts and New York are requested to direct their naval militia to assume charge of the monitors assigned for the protection of the Boston and New York, in conjunction with the land fortifications. The orders seat to Gov. Wolcott, of Massachusetts, and Gov. Black, of New York, for transmission to the commanding officers of the State naval militia inform them that they will be directed to assume charge of the monitors assigned to each of those States to assist in the second line of defence [sic].

The Boston men will be sent on board when the monitors Catskill and Lehigh arrive, and the New Yorkers may proceed to Philadelphia and take their two ships around. A naval officer will be in command of each monitor, and under him will be naval militia officers and sufficient seamen from each organization to give the ships their complements. Instructions have also been sent [ ]  hold the Western organizations to transport themselves in readiness [ ] they will be sent to the East, wh[ ] and with wh[ ] gu[ ] be procured are to [ ] crews.

[Indecipherable] not my policy to wait for [ ] to come. I can’t do it. I have not the patience. I must be up and at it. I mean to do business at all the time if I have no loose money to help it along. Spring trade will be in shortly but that is by and bye. I want trade today.

I will coax trade where I can, when I can’t I will drive it. That is the reason of these driving prices.
