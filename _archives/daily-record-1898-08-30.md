## A Homeless Mascott.
New York, Aug. 29 - Mayor Powell, chief surgeon of the United States transport Rio Grande. accompanied by a diminutive Negro boy, entered the offices of the Gerry society in Twenty-Third street last evening. He said the lad was Herbert Horner, eight years old, and that his father was a member of the Ninth Cavalry and had been killed at the battle of El Caney.

The little fellow, who was attired in garments much too large for him, cast-off clothes of soldiers chiefly, said that until two years ago he had lived with his parents in Tampa. His mother had then come to this city to go to a hospital. Since then he had not seen her. A few months ago his father enlisted in the Ninth Cavalry at Fernandina, Fla. The boy accompanied that regiment to Santiago, but when his father was killed, Capt. West of Troop A, Sixth Cavalry, took the little chap as a regimental mascott, and he remained with the Sixth until Troop A reached Camp Wikoff.

The Gerry Society will endeavor to find the boy’s mother. When she left home, he said she was accompanied by a younger brother and sister. Magistrate Flammer, sitting in the Jefferson Market Police Court this morning, committed the boy to the care of the society pending the resolutions.

## Advices From Santiago.
Washington, Aug. 29. -The following despatch [sic] has been received at the War Department:

Santiago de Cuba via Hayti, Aug. 22. Adjutant General, Washington. August 28th, total sick, 380; total fever, 322; new cases fever, 9; returned to duty, 97; deaths, 7.

(Signed) LAWTON, Commanding. 

Washington, Aug. 29-Adjutant General Corben has received the following cablegram from Gen. Shafter under date of Santiago:
         
“I have today transferred all business relations to customs over to Major General Lawton. There has been collected with the exception of a small amount, $102,093. Salaries of officers and all expenses, including street cleaning, city officials, police, etc., have been paid to date, leaving over $90,000 in the treasury. The expenses of the custom houses have been cut down from $40,000 to $28,000, per annum, and that in time, can be materially reduced. These collections are all made under the minimum tariff, including a large reduction in tonnage. The economy and celerity which has characterized the business of the customs has been brought about in a great measure under the supervision and good management of Donalson.”

## Jimmie Michael Beaten by a Negro.

It was a mile paced race, the first heat of which Michael won owing to an accident to Taylor’s machine. Taylor took the next two heats, finishing, the last in 1:41 2-5. The former record was 1:45 2-5

## A Woman as Assistant Surgeon.
Washington, Aug. 29.-Today for the first time in the history of the American army a woman was a appointed as a member of the medical staff. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, wife of Prof. W.J. McGee, of this city, and daughter of Prof Simmons Newcomb, formerly of the Naval Observatory, was regularly sworn in as an acting assistant surgeon. This, according to Secretary Alger’s general order, would entitle her to the uniform of a second lieu-tenant without the designation of rank. It is not likely, however, that Dr. McGee will avail herself of this privilege. The appointment, while a novelty from a technical stand-point, is not the beginning of Dr. McGee’s service with the War Department. Throughout the war she has been in charge of the selection of the women nurses and of the seven hundred or more now in the field most have passed muster at her hands.

Dr. McGee has regularly practiced her profession in Washington for some years and is well known in medical circles throughout this country, having contributed several papers to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and to other scientific organizations.

## A Cuban’s Generosity.
Fremont, O., Aug. 29.-John Meek of this county, father of George B. Meek, who was killed on the torpedo boat Winslow, at Cardenas, May 11th has received a letter and a check for $100. The letter goes on to show that young Meek was the first American born sailor killed in the Cuban
war. The letter received by Mr. Meek reads as follows:

Washington, D. C. Aug. 24. John Meek, Esq:

Dear Sir:-Some months ago, a Cuban gentleman, who signs himself Cambresis, from the city of Mexico, sent General Tomas Estrada Palma of New York, an order for a hundred dollars to be given to the wife, children or parents of the first American born sailor who should die in the war to free Cuba. I have just now been informed that your son, George B. Meek, fireman of the first class, on board the torpedo boat Winslow, was the first hero to shed his blood for the independence of our unfortunate and downtrodden people.

I beg to inclose [sic] you the check entrusted to my care, being a proof of the gratitude of the Cubans for their friends and allies, the Americans. Please acknowledge the receipt of the same in duplicate.
    
Yours very respectfully,

Gonzalo de Ruesado.

Charge d'Affaires of the Republic of Cuba.

The check is dated May 17th and is drawn on the Bank of America , to the order of Tomas Estrada Palma, and is signed Maitland, Coppell & Co.

On the reverse side it is endorsed: “Pay to the order of Gonzola deQuesado.”

Tomas estrada Palma 

“Meek has not as yet had the check cashed and has already been offered more than its face value by parties who want it as a souvenir of the war.

## A Crew Rescued.

**Eighth New York Regiment Arrives**  
**In a Critical Condition -- Situation at Montauk Point Much Improved in Health**

(Telegraphed to the Record.) Charlevoix Aug. 30.- The steamer Superior was rescued from Beaver Island by the steamer Charlevoix today. The Superior had sunk off Gulf Island three days ago, the crew took to the boats and reached Beaver Island where they remained for forty-eight hours without food or shelter until they discovered by the city of Charlevoix brought here.

Utica, Aug. 30.-The Eighth New York arrived at 9 o'clock this morning. The men are suffering intensely, forty are too sick to leave their berths and some are on the point of death. Cries of delirium were plainly heard as the train passed. It was veritably a pest train. There is only one physician in charge of two hundred and thirty six men who refused outside assistance.

Montauk, Aug. 30. - The conditions are rapidly improving, there is much less suffering among the troops, but it is has been suggested that the regulars receive the most care. The troopship Hudson arrived this morning with six huddred [sic]  of First District of Columbia regiment aboard.

Nashville , Aug. 30. -Furniture and hardware stores, bank ally and college street were destroyed by fire this morning; loss half a million dollars.

## Relic of the Armada.
One of the sights in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba is the remains of the old St. Paul, one of the ships of the Spanish Armada that Philip II sent to England in 1588, being one of the very few of that famous flotilla that escaped destruction at the time. What a career this old ship has been through! She had breasted the waves of many seas and wichstood [sic] the storms in many waters for nearly three centuries, when she was burned to the water’s edge here in Santiago harbor a few years ago and sunk where her remains now lie covered with barnacles, an emblem of the nation whose flag she once so proudly bore. During the last years of her career afloat she was used as a transport for troops from Europe and as a Spanish Guard ship in these seas by the local government. She can only be seen at low water. Only ribs and stanchions are held together by the stout keel and and timbers and lower sheathing . The Spaniards would probably have tried to destroy even this part of the wreck if they had supposed that the American “Jackie's” would have made these timbers into relics of there [sic] victory, if they can find them, as they probably will. -San Francisco Chronicle.

## Get Trades.

In taking a summary of the situation the fact at once becomes apparent that the Afro-American is neglecting the cultivating of the trades and the mechanical and industrial avenues to an extent past belief. Take for instance, as a subject for comparison any of the larger cities of the land and find out how many in proportion to numbers are skilled workmen in any of the mechanical and industrial pursuits. Few Indeed if any can be found. And still in studying up conditions presented, the fact is apparent that more Afro Americans should apply themselves to the trades.  There is a great demand for skilled labor and the Afro-American, competent and capable of competing along these lines, will not be long without employment at wages that mean at least independence.  Mechanical and industrial pursuits today, offers as much to the Afro-American, who can read between the lines as any of the professional callings that might be named. -Michigan Representative                                                                                                   

## Negroes Terrorized
Dallas, Texas, Aug. 27.- A reign of terror exists all over northern [illegible] Negroes. They are flocking to Dallas for protection. Whitecaps in Denton, Rockwell, Grayson, Kaufman, Fannin and other counties are to blame. Outrages have been perpetrated in numerous places during the last thirty days including whipping and shooting Negroes for various criminal offences, and blowing up a half dozen or more houses by dynamite.

Negro districts and suburbs of Dallas are crowded with strangers. Chief of Police Cordwell says there are nearly 2,000 strange Negroes here and ore coming. Police Capt. Ceehan says 200 came in last night, and were huddled together like sheep. The police and sheriff’s department find the race problem a difficult problem to solve. Robberies are increasing, but officers believe most of them is the work of white thieves, who argue that the crimes will be charge to strange Negroes.

Rochester, N.Y. Aug.- Miss Fannie Beck and Charles C. Herrick of this city were drowned at Windsor Beach on Lake Ontario last night while bathing.

Among the members of the crew of the Nantucket who arrived this morning are Messrs. Chas. Martin, John Myers, Griffin Allen, Thomas Holmes, James Muldrow, Louis Bryant, David McClarney and Robt. Thomas.

We call especial attention to the large and attractive advertisement of Mr. A.W. Rivenbark, the popular grocer. Mr. Rivenbark needs no introduction to the people of this city. His long business carreer [sic] is his strongest recommendation. Give him you patronage.

Our popular friend, Mr. Jacob S. Wilson, head cotton grader for Alexander Sprunt & Son, Cotton Importers, arrived yesterday from his home Lincolnville S.C., to resume his season’s work.

The Wilmington Division of the Naval Reserves arrived this morning about 8 a.m. There was a large [illegible] arrival. They were mustered [ ] service Sunday.

Quite a large number of citizens left yesterday to attend the New Berne Fair, which is reported as being the finest held in that city for years. 

Mrs. Fannie Gather and Miss Della Story did not leave yesterday for New Berne as was reported but they will leave today.

Every colored man should by [sic] himself a little plot of ground and erect himself a little house thereon. If it takes ten years to pay for a home it is well worth making the effort to buy one.  Planning to buy one after you have saved up something for that purpose never amounts to much. Most men succeed when pressed the hardest.

It is said that in proportion to his wealth, the Negro is the best dressed individual on earth. We take this as a very doubtful compliment. Cleanliness is an essential to life, but fine clothes do not make a man. Try to get something more than an extensive wardrobe.

There are a number of well-to-do colored men in this city who succeeded only through persistent efforts coupled with rigid economy. The secret of their success is that they spent less than they earned.

## nRICH MEN IN KANSAS

Every Town Has One Who is Measured by a Local Standard

There are no rich men in Kansas towns. The men who own a million dollars’ worth of property number less than half a score in the whole state, says Atlantic. Those who number half a million dollars’ worth of property might ride together in a sleeping car with an upper berth or two to spare.  Every town has its rich man, measured by a local standard, who is frequently a retired farmer turned banker, but not one in five of these is rated at $100.-[ ] 000. Yet each is the autocrat of his county, if he cares to be. The mainspring that moves the town’s daily machinery may be found in the back room of the bank. There it is decided whether or not the bonds shall be voted. There it is often determined whether there shall be eight or nine months of school. There the village chronicles are spread upon the great ledgers every day. The town banker supplies the money for every contest. If he is wise, he watches his little corner of the world as a spider watches from his web. The great trust which he keeps requires a knowledge of the details of the game that men are playing around him. Yet with all his power, this town banker would be counted a poor man in the city. Seldom is his annual income as much as $10,000. But he lives in the best house in town. The butcher saves his best cuts for him, the grocer puts aside his best vegetables, and the whole town waits to do his bidding.

## LANGUAGE OF JEWELRY

**Symbolism Is Carried Into Articles for Female Adornment**

Human Fancy, which looks for symbolic meaning in everything, has found the proper symbolism of jewelry. It is said, remarks the Philadelphia Record, that in making a present of jewelry the first matter to be considered is the color of the hair of the recipient. It is supposed that brunettes possess mainly positive qualities, as intelligence, discretion, etc., while the blonds are believed to be more lively and idealy [sic] inclined. Since silver symbolized fancy and enthusiasm it should prevail in the jewelry of dark-haired persons, for thus they receive what they lack-poetry and idealism. In the jewelry of blonds, however, gold should predominate, for this metal will dampen their vivacity and weaken their fancy.

Of the gems rubies and garnets are considered the symbols for wisdom and good common sense, and are, therefore, fit gifts for blonds. Other gems best suited for light-haired beauties are the topaz, the turquoise and the sapphire. Brunettes should be presented with the amethyst, the stone of hope or the emerald.

The king of gems, the diamond, is the symbol for elegance. It suits all, the blond and brunette. Pearls symbolize tears in popular superstition, and brides particularly should not wear these gems of the sea, for wearing them at the wedding indicates the coming of tearful days.

## HALIFAXT FORT STR-[illegible]

**[illegible] Authorities Making Important Changes There**

In a quiet way the British military authorities are strengthening the station at Halifax, N.S. The imperial troops in the garrisons there are to be increased by the addition of 600 royal artillerymen, making the total 1,000. It is probable that the Royal Berkshire regiment will be sent direct to England from Halifax instead of to Bermuda as intended.

Plans have been made for a new quick firing battery to be constructed at Point Pleasant by the imperial authorities. Out of the sum voted by the imperial government for Halifaxian amount will be taken to erect a commodious stable, as it is the intention of the military authorities to place here two or more batteries, or royal horse artillery. The horses will be purchased at Halifax, but the guns and all equipments [sic] will be sent from England. It is also stated that next summer a quick-firing battery will be constructed on George’s Island. The guns will be of the very latest pattern. Another powerful searchlight in addition to the one proposed for Sleepy cove is to be erected in a prominent position near the entrance to the harbor.

**THE FLYING BICYCLE**
**Aerial Wheel Will Never Be Realized, Says Maxim**

Suggestions of a flying bicycle have been numerous in recent years, but Hiram Maxim, or Maxim gun fame, gives cold encouragement to the ambitious wheeler who would rise with the lark and while away his leisure in midair.

It will never be possible for a man to drive the flying machine with his feet, Mr. Maxim told an interviewer the other day, because the power a man can develop in this [illegible] small in comparison with [illegible] added to his own weight.

Though a man may work up to one-horse power for a few seconds, Mr. Maxim explains, in order to fly he would have to work up to and maintain two or three horse power, and his machine, moreover, must be of practically no weight at all. A man would require two or three horse power to lift his own weight, and a machine of any weight would require increased power in proportion.

On the whole, this assurance of Mr. Maxim’s will probably be received with consolation, rather that disappointment to cycledom.

## Just the Place for a Barn

An old Sussex farmer visiting London for the first time was taken into St. Paul’s cathedral. He stared about him in amazement, and his astonishment at the magnitude of the building seemed too great for utterance. It was only when he stood under the dome and gazed down the vast [ ] and up to the dim and misty roof that his admiration at last found [vent? ] in words: “My! what a [foine?] barn this [ ]!” 

## THE DOG [ILLEGIBLE]
**Eaten by iMany Rac[ ] Time Im- memo-[ ]**

“The more we know [illegible], the more we like dogs,” writes [ ] –anthropically that great friend of animals, M. Toussenel. Perhaps it is because the inhabitants of the Colonial empire do not know men sufficiently that they still regard the dog [ ]-dible animal, and as one of the [ ] savory of morsels. But it is to [ ]-ped that in the progress of civili[ ] a day will come when these brave animals- “candidates for humanity” according to Michelet’s picturesque expression- will no longer figure [ ] the menus of state dinners at the court of Peking.

Darwin relates some [ ]here that when the inhabitants of Te-[ ] del Fuego are pressed by famine they kill and eat their old women rather than their dogs, and that in Australia fathers will sacrifice their children in order that the mothers may be able to nourish this useful servant of man. The Chinese, however, tend and fatten their dogs carefully- to eat. They also consider that cat a choice dish.[ ]bbe Le Noir in “Travels in the Far East,” relates that in the markets of many cities are to be seen dogs and cats [illegible] side by side by the head [illegible] on most farms these a[illegible] in little coops like [illegible]remain thus from [illegible] condemned to almost [illegible] immobility, and are fed [illegible]-ing but a mixture of rice and [illegible]. We do not know the edible dog [illegible] the edible cat in France, but probably [ ] the siege they have been but li-[ ] served- openly at least- on the [ ] of Paris restaurants. At Peking and throughout China, however, there is not dainty repast without its fill[ ] on leg of dog; the cat is rather a dish of the poorer classes.

These same customs that are so repulsive to us as to seem like a kind of semi-cannibalism existed nevertheless, among the people of classic antiquity. History tells us that in early times the dog was always regarded as an edible animal. The inhabitants of certain nomes of Egypt piously embalmed their dead dogs, but others considered that it was more in conformity to the doctrines of a wise economy to kill and eat them. Plutarch tells us that the dwellers in Cynopolis, where dogs were honored [ ] divine, made war on the Oxyrinchis, who had committed the sacrilege of eating dogs. In his book on Diet, Hippocrates, speaking of common articles of food, is of the opinion that the flesh of the dog gives heat and strength, but is difficult of digestion. “Our fathers,” says Pliny, “regarded small dog, as so pure a food that they used them for expiatory victims. Even to-day young dogs’ flesh is served at feasts held in honor of the god.” And further[ ]: “This meat was used in the in[ ]ation feasts of the pontiffs.” According to Apicius, who has left us [illegible] treatise “On Cookery,” the R[ ]ate also adult dogs.

The savages [illegible], for –ack of provi[ ] their [illegible] that before the [illegible] cattle the Spaniards in [ ] the native dogs so freely [illegible] the species has now [completely? illegible] disappeared. According to Ca-[ ] the natives of New Zealand at [illegible] and clothed themselves in the [illegible] Forster adds: “They love the fl[ ] passionately, and prefer it to that [ ] pig.” The Greenlanders and [ ] Kamchatkans also sometimes eat [ ] dogs, but only when reduced to [ ] cruel extremity by famine. In Africa dogs from the food of certain negro tribes; in the Ashantee country the flesh is eaten both fresh and dried. Andi it appears that in the lower Congo region, among the Batekes, there is a custom that must make every friend of dumb beasts rage with indignation-before killing a dog for food it is maltreated and tortured to make the flesh more tender. – La Nature

## VILLAGES AND HOGPENS
**A Source of Disease and Injury to Country Towns**

It is really remarkable what a part the hog-pen plays in the well-being and prosperity of the country. There are in the United States 30,000 or 40,000 villages of different sizes, and the most of the me have hog-pens and typhoid fever. The connection is uniform and direct. The hog-pen supplies the cause, and the fever, or some disease closely allied to it, is the effect.

It has taken a long while to convince even the most intelligent settlements of the value of scientific sanitation, and in the large cities it is a constant fight to abate nuisances and [illegible] people to observe ordinary laws [ ]liness. But in the villages it is [illegible] worse. The population [illegible]. [illegible] they [illegible] call [illegible] of a board of [illegible] and an impertinence. We knew [illegible] villages were the doctors have been laboring in vain for years to eliminate the hog-pen and the fevers, which would never exist but for the uncleanliness, remain.

After awhile [sic] the people of these small places will see the importance of a different policy. When they realize that the existence of hog-pens in a community will keep away all settlers whose presence would be desirable, and when they see their property depreciating in value because no one wants to live in villages where no attempt is made to prevent disease, but everything is done to encourage it, they may find it to their advantage to send the hogs to the country, and then the health and welfare of the whole nation will be improved. –Leslie’s Weekly

“This is the end!” he angrily exclaimed. “Give me back my engagement bicycle!”

## MILK AND MICROBES
**A Fruitful Source of the Ills Which Afflict Humankind** 

**Millions of Bacteria in a Thimbleful of the Lacteal Fluid-Protective Measures Employed in All the Large Cities**

Nowadays, when there is an epidemic anywhere of typhoid fever, one of the first things which physicians do is to inquire into the milk supply. This is not because all such outbreaks are traceable to impure milk, but because milk has been found to be one of the most fruitful sources of contagion.

Milk absorbs impurities readily without giving any trace of their presence, and it is one of the few articles of food in common use which are not cooked before being eaten. For these reasons, and because it is given freely to infants and invalids, who are especially susceptible to disease, it is a dangerous vehicle of contagion.

Careful experiments have shown that milk freshly drawn from a healthy cow is practically sterile, that is, is free from bacteria; but before it reaches the [illegible] especially in the large cities, [illegible] the hands or the clothes of the man who milks her are dirty. The milk is transported perhaps a hundred and fifty miles; it is emptied and mixed by different hands as it is distributed from the contractor to the milkmen, and by them to their customers, and at every stage it is liable to gather impurities. It reaches the consumer 36 or 48 hours after if leaves the cow.

A thimbleful of milk has been found often to contain millions of bacteria. Most of these are harmless vegetable germs, but among them sometimes are germs of typhoid fever and tuberculosis. If some one who handles the milk along the route is afflicted with one of these maladies, there germs may be transmitted to become active a hundred miles away.

The protection of the milk supply is one of the most difficult problems of city life. Where there is a system of inspection of milk, it usually extends no further than tests to ascertain whether there has been dilution with water; but such adulteration is not nearly so serious an evil as the transmission of disease microbes.

To insure pure milk, it is essential that there should be care at every point along the route. There must be absolute cleanliness of the stable and the cow and the persons who handle the milk and there should be as little delay as possible in its delivery.

There is a close connection between impure milk and mortality among infants. Several years ago investigation in Philadelphia showed that out of 75,000 children born in three years, nearly one-fourth died before completing their first year. In most instances death was caused by diseases of the digestive organs, and the ratio of such cases was highest among children whose food was milk fed by hand.

The sterilization of milk, through the agency of heat, removes this peril. A rich New York merchant has for several summers supplied sterilized milk to tenement house children, with an immediate result in reducing the mortality among them. Last summer the experiment was extended to Brooklyn. In July, before the sterilized milk was distributed, from 18 to 28 per cent. of the deaths of children under two year of age were from diarrheal diseases. In August, with sterilized milk in use, the percentage dropped first to 13, then to 12 and 11.

The possibility of preventing disease by guarding against the transmission of disease microbes is something that we owe to modern science. Thirty years ago, in such diseases as typhoid fever, all that doctors could do was to treat the individual case and prevent immediate contagion. Now it is possible to check the disease at its source. Nowhere is the superiority of prevention over cure more manifest than here.

By the concerted action of legislatures and health authorities, and the watchfulness of an intelligent public sentiment, the knowledge which has been gained of disease microbes can be utilized to prevent their transmission through milk or their vehicles of contagion.

## He Cut Her in Two

She was nervous and scared as she penetrated the city’s purlieus. A freight train was being switched down there, and loud-voiced switchman was giving instructions to another of his craft. Switchmen have a language all their own, which is incomprehensible to the plain, everyday, non-railroading citizen. Among other things they call a train “her” and “she” just as a sailor refers to a ship, and just as she neared the switchman, this is what he yelled. “Head her off, Jim; cut her in two and send the head end up here.” She fled from the murderous villain, and postponed her voyage across the raging Mississippi. Meanwhile the other switchman obeyed orders. He cut the train in two and sent the head end back. –St. Louis Post –Dispatch

## Zana’s Sister.

The proverbial unattractiveness of new infants was illustrated afresh in the little sister which came to Zana’s house. Zana liked and admired the youngster. But Zana is a clergyman’s daughter, and is being reared to speak the truth under all circumstances. Her mother overheard her confiding to the neighbors’ little girl the news about her very small sister. Zana, by the way, is six years old. “Oh, you ought to see my teenty-weenty sister!” she said. 
She is perfickly [sic] beautiful- all- all but her face.” N.Y. Press.

## CASTLES IN SPAIN
How fair they rise  
From hyacinthine meadow-ground that lies  
Within the shade.  
By snow-capped heights of wild sierras made.  

How gleaming white  
Those battlements beneath the morning light!  
How marbles show  
Their brilliancy against the eternal snow!  

How roof and spire   
Are daily kindled to a flashing fire,  
And over all  
Folds of silken banner rise and fall!  

The court below  
Is moated with a stream of gentle flow,  
Whose crystal face  
Reduplicates the beauty of the place.  

The perfumed breeze  
Comes through the branches of fruit-laden trees,  
And song of bird,  
Flute-like and mellow, from the copse is heard.  

With soothing sound  
Cool fountains scatter jewels all around,  
In flashing spray  
The rainbow bends its arch above our way.  

We enter there  
With bosom friends we bid our joys to share:  
We rest at ease:  
We go again at any time we please.

From mortal eyes  
Were veiled the glories bright of Paradise,  
Yet there remain  
These glorious castles all our own- in Spain.

## The Gray Steer

Twelve hundred feet high in the sun-dial of the Lazy J Ranch and nearly as broad --that cliff of divers hues which stands out from the wall of the canon of Grand river. The opposite precipice serves the cowboys as gnomon or index to the hours of day shadow sweeps over the stupendous, variegated face and marks the course of the sun through a sky that is always unclouded. A ledge of porphyry, fifty feet deep, crowns the dial; often it looks like a strip of pink ribbon to the men below by the stream. But it was a glorious coronal, kindling in the first rays from the east, when Holden hailed it with uplifted eye and hand as he quirted [sic] his horse through the barway of the corral.

“Sunup!” cried Holden, the young foreman, filled with the joy of the morning. He is the son of president of the cattle company; he had come straight from college to the cow camp, and the old stroke of the ‘varsity eight set a hot pace in saddle for the Lazy J riders. He rode that morning a big-boned, Roman-nosed, blue-roan “outlaw”--a horse pronounced irreclaimable by the boys; he had tied a bucking roll across the shoulders of his saddle to supplement the grip of his knees, and on top of that lay the big loose coil of his fifty-foot cable line, for he was still young enough to disdain a lariat of lesser length and caliber.            

Behind Holden Navajo Jim lifted a light left foot to the stirrup; then his spurred right tripped clinking to the evasive dance of his young horse, and he slipped inimitably into his saddle. To its right shoulder hung the trim coiled ring of his rope of braided rawhide, which, to that of the foreman, was as steel to iron and would hold anything on hoofs.         

Foreman and follower struck out through the greasewood over ground without grass; the grazing range lay high on the mesa, fenced by the lofty wall of the canon. Its seemingly inaccessible height was scaled by the sure-footed, agile range cattle at a break in the porphyry ledge not far up the canon, and presently they took to dizzy trail.   

With slack cinches the blowing horses clawed up the loose footing at the top of the break and moved out on a narrow projecting tongue of the mesa. Still higher the mesa broadened and was set with squat cedars and pinons. Here riders saw cattle already chewing their cuds in the shade. 

“We’re too low down. There’s nothing here,” said young foreman, his eyes roving over the stock. 

“It’s beef I’m after.  I’ve got to get a train-road off by the first and not a hundred steers gathered yet!”

“Quaking-asp putty good place for steer now,” said Navajo Jim. “Water sweet there and stampin’-ground close.” 

“Yes I know,” Holden returned impatiently. “The boys started twenty head down yesterday and had them pointed for the corral, when that blamed gray steer scattered the bunch, and they broke back for the hills” 

“That gray steer like bull elk. Better corral him with six-shooter.” said Jim.  “One steer not much worth” 

“Six-shooter nothing!  What’s our ropes for?” cried Holden.  “That big grizzly brute will fetch up a whole carload to the top notch in the stock-pens. He goes hoof to Omaha. I told the boys I’d give a 50-dollar saddle to the first man that ‘twined’ him and stayed with him.”

“I already got putty[sic] good saddle, Mr. Holden” said Jim with a grin. [text obscured] year old now, [text obscured]. Horns so long [text obscured] through horse.”

“Well beef’s up in the air; horses are down.” returned the foreman. “Quirt [sic] up, Jim.  We’ll strike up higher.” 

On the  loftier grazing-ground they found the cattle still at feed. Through thickening hosts of deer-flies and horse-flies their horses strained up the steep oakbrush slopes. In banded resistance to like winged attacks, the cattle of the higher range were beginning to “bunch” on each open stamping-ground. Toward  these trampled circles the scattered steers were one by one making their way.

“The boys can run in all these steers tomorrow,” said Holden “ You and I, Jim, are going to twine that gray steer today.” 
    
“He got big scare yesterday; too sharp to show up on stamping’-ground today,” Jim suggested. 

“Like enough,” Holden assented, “but we’ll rustle him out. The boys lost him late yesterday in the long quaking-asp patch in that gulch up there, just below the rim-rock” 
    
He pointed to the rim-rock of the spruce ridge, rising yet loftily above them with innumerable aspen gulches and brushy slopes draining down into the side canons. 

Quickening their horses, they presently rode into the green gloom of the gulch, where the quaking-aspens trembled over [illegible] . Here mighty hoofprints dinted[sic] deep in the mud and the sodden trails. 

“Dere[sic] his track, fresh,” said Jim, stooping from his saddle over a print like post-hole. “He lie close, somewhere.”   

“We’ll put him up,” said Holden, confidently; “and once he shows, stay with him, Jim.” 

“You bet I stay!” said Jim, simply.
	
They threaded the winding thicket on separate trails and met near its head without a sight of the gray steer. “It’s no use looking for him down in here,” said Holden. “He’s gone up higher. Let’s try in the spruce below the rim-rock.” 

He led the way upward along the steep, brushy side of the gulch until, stopped by the rim-rock, they sat in their saddles and looked down in disappointment.  

Below them gulch enclosed the fastness of the deer, a space darkened to twilight by a growth of young spruce and aspen saplings.

“Maybe he down in those,” said Jim, with a drop alike of voice and hand. “ Hide hisself[sic] in daytime like blacktail buck.”  

“But we can’t get into that ‘pocket’ on horses,” Holden replied loudly, in vexation. “Wait! I’ll try for him!” 

As he spoke he dismounted to act on a boyish inspiration.

He had noticed a big block fallen from rim-rock and lying tilted up on the slope. With mighty heaving he overturned it, and down the slope it crashed in smashing leaps through the brush and swaying timber to the very heart of the spruce thicket. 

Snorts came up from below; Holden marked the course of startled, hurrying creatures by the lines of swaying tops furrowing the still, green surface, and three grand bucks sprang out, their horns showing brown in the velvet as they topped the lower brush; but a bearer of mightier horns was breaking through the pliant young trees, and a glimpse of a grizzly hide was exultantly caught by the young foreman.

“Ah, he show up now!” shouted Navajo Jim, erect in the stirrups, as the great steer came out below.

Bred from the finest of Lazy J stock, he would have weighed near 2000 pounds; but such speed and bottom were his “rustling” on that rough range that the big body rose over the brush with the wild grace of a buck and with deer-like ease his frontlet, black and threatening, was thrown back over his grizzly shoulder as he stopped and eyed his hunters for an instant. One defiant shake of his perfect horns, then he raced onward, and only bending brush marked his path.

Holden was already galloping after him, smashing undergrowth in a straight course down the slope to intercept him below, shouting as he ran. Jim, with Indian circumspection, ran his horse in an easier descent along the slope, keeping his eyes on the swaying brush beneath and waiting for an opportunity of closing in more open ground. 

Now Holden’s horse, the blue outlaw, showed once more his spirit and brought Holden close behind the game. Navajo Jim emerged from the thicket to see the young foreman in full career, swinging his big rope, while the haltered head of the horse and the huge-horned frontlet of the steer reached out in an even race across the little open space beyond. 

The loop of Holden’s cable lit fairly over the widespread horns; but his hand was hardly quick enough in closing it. While it hung slack the steer leaped with both front legs through it, and then Holden’s tardy jerk brought it tight around the grizzly flanks. 
    
The beast bellowed as the plunge of his great gray body drew the turn of the rope swiftly from the saddle horn. Vainly Holden tried to stay it. Recklessly he threw the slack end in a hitch around the steel horn and clapping his hand over it braced his horse for the shock.

With forelegs outplanted[sic] and quarters lowered, the stubborn blue outlaw stauchly[sic] set himself to the tightening rope. For an instant he was jerked along, stiff-legged, then over they went, dragged down, fierce horse and reckless roper. 

Clearing his legs, hanging at the side of his struggling horse, Holden still held the saddle-horn with powerful grasp.[sic for grammar] Another bawl, a plunge that no cinches could withstand- and, lo, the saddle was stripped from the outlaw and jerked high and far from Holden’s hand! 

Navajo Jim checked his horse, but “On!” roared the young foreman, and on the obedient Indian spurred after the wild steer and the flying saddle. 

The great steer seemed scarcely to feel the 50-pound drag of the bumping saddle. Yet it tightened the rope about loin and flanks, and by making it harder for him to breathe so lessened his speed that Jim easily kept him in sight. Through yielding brush and swaying thicket, through bunches of frightened cattle that split to let him pass and came stringing after, bucking and bawling in sympathy, the brute plunged on. 

Each bawling bunch in turn was distanced. The brushy slopes broke away. As the mesa, sprinkled with pinons, began to offer to Jim smooth spaces for handling his horse, he unbuckled the strap that held the coil of his rope, but still, as every leap of the steer took him the nearer to the corral, the wise Indian only held the rawhide ringed ready in his hand.

Down the rapidly narrowing tongue of the mesa-- the mesa which tipped precipitously out into the river-gorge and was bounded on either side by an abyss-- the trapped steer sped. He must soon be at a standstill or attempt to return on his tracks. 

The Indians eyes had already kindled with anticipation of triumph, when at the last of the pinons the bumping, hurtling saddle caught fast between projecting roots. It scarcely checked the steer! Holden’s cable tore loose from the saddle-horn, and its slackened loop was speedily kicked from the steer’s high-plunging haunches. Once more the great gray brute was free. 

“Ah, he on the push now!” said Jim and looked to his loop as the steer reversed his big body, gave a high, writhing leap over the spurned rope, confronted the herder with the threatening crescent of his sharp horns and plunged forward to the combat. 

The Navajo lifted his horse aside with the spurs, swung the loop open in his right hand and rose, half turned in the stirrups, in a quick underthrow for the front hoofs of the steer as he lunged by. 

Jim’s eyes saw, for an instant, lowered horns and uplifted hoofs mingled together, and his throw was true. But so quick was the play of ponderous feet that the loop caught one foreleg only and passed over the face and hung across the horns.

The loop, drawn tight by the roper’s instantaneous jerk and kept from slackening by his nimble horse, bound horn and hoof together. Now the steer was in sad plight. With head drawn sidewise, with tongue lolling from open jaws, bellowing, he surged on three legs, but his spirit was unbroken.

The roper slowed his horse to the strain. From horn to cantle the saddle creaked as, trampling and tugging in a wild, wide waltz, straining horse and hauling steer made the mad circuit of the precipices. 

The Navajo, active in the saddle with rein, spur and rope, was, in spite of all his efforts, dragged past the break where the trail ran down the slope. His horse, always straining desperately, was tugged on and on until he circled along the perilous porphyry brink, and Jim glanced longingly from the saddle on the corral, seemingly almost directly beneath him, it's great square shrunk to the measure of his saddle-blanket. 

Holden, pounding down bareback on the blue roan, had stopped to gather up his rope, but now Jim heard his encouraging shout. The quickened tramp of his rushing horse, the whirring of his big rope as he swung it aloft, sounded close at hand, and the sweating roper relaxed his strain. 

The steer, alert to the slack, jerked his hoof from the loop. Heedless of the cutting rope, instantly tightened across face and frontlet, his stately head was lifted, and he stood, wild-eyed quivering, cornered, caught but not conquered. He was on four legs again. Conquered? Never! With resistless pull on the rope, he wheeled and broke for escape across the cliff that rises, red-banded, above the corral. 

“Stay with him, Jim!” roared the young foreman, swinging his rope, sure the steer would stop at the edge.

Stay with him? It meant death surely. Already under the plunging front hoofs of the desperate rebel the porphyry rim crumbled. Jim’s obedience did not falter, although he was fairly staring down on the corral. How would the falling feel? 

The Indian had a swift picture of it-- the steer lowest in the air on the taught lariat, horse and man whirling after-- but Navajo Jim set his savage jaws. No foreman should dare him to stay with a roped beast. He would not look on the faces of white ropers sneering. He was hired body and soul-- he was obedient--he would stay. 

Holden, for this mad second, watched incredulously. The steer would not go over-- surely not. What? Straight on! And Jim! Was the man also crazy? Then the Navajo heard once more his masters voice. 

“For God’s sake, Jim-- let go! O heavens!” 

Jim obeyed. He flung loose the rope, but on his horse staggered. And the black length of the lariat was still whipping out with the defiant horned head that pitched off into space when the agile horse saved himself and his rider on the very brink.  

Holden dropped his useless rope as the Navajo, skimming the porphyry edge like a swallow, rode back and stared into the eyes of the white man.

“He was brave, that steer,” said Jim, with a queer choke in his throat. “He saved himself from the stock pens.” 

Holden held out his hand and grasped the Indian’s. “You beat my time, Jim,” was all he said, but something in the tone called a new pride into the Navajo’s stern face

## “The Expanding South.”

The New York Commercial Advertiser in its issue of the 26th inst. presents an exhaustive and interesting article under the above head, being the expressions of Richard H. Edmonds, editor of the Baltimore Manufacturer’s Journal.

Mr. Edwards, begins his talk by referring to the great advertisement given our country and especially the South, thro [sic] the present war. He says that the benifits [sic] are beyond computation as it directs the attention for the world to our wonderful resources.

We cannot enter into an elaborate discussion of this subject, but will try to point out a few of the benefits which must come to the Negro from “The Expanding South.”

Throughout the south agriculture is an essential industry and from years of training we have become proficient in the requirements for this particular line of occupation. The cotton industry, says Mr. Edmonds will naturally expand as the requirement increases, and nowhere on earth can the supply come up to the demand as in America. Following the agricultural production of cotton, comes the industrial production of cotton goods. In this line, too, we are showing signs of interest by building for ourselves cotton mills, or by becoming operatives in the mills, owned by others. The field of industry as it broadens in the South naturally encircles those who live within its borders, and though at first there may be some inclination toward discrimination, the evident demand for labor requires the utilization of that in hand before seeking elsewhere for help. Economy goes a long way toward directing the projectors of enterprizes [sic] who to employ, and after a while they naturally seek for the largest amount of profit at the smallest out[illegible] The importers use the most [illegible] labor, and we [illegible] profitable employment throughout all the South. Mr. Edmonds points out the fact that while low priced cotton may be a discouragement to some individual farmers, it becomes of especial advantage to the South in that it gives the South a monopoly which it otherwise would not have. Couple to this the fact that the South is manufacturing and consuming its own products, we gain through the reduction of profits on the manufactured goods. 

Mr. Edwards turns from cotton to iron and in figures proceeds to show the relation the south holds to the world. Alabama is pointed to as “the ruling spirit” in the market of pig iron and there is little doubt that steel will be the next step in the forward march. Here again our people come in for a share for we find that, from the mine to the machine shop, the Negro is utilized with profit to himself and his employers.

Mr. Edmonds points to this as an evidence of Anglo-Saxon domination in the affairs of our great civilization; the Negro comes in as a part of that civilization and will prosper with the prosperity which must come to us on this return of peace.	

Mr. Edmonds gives us a most hopeful view of the future, not only for the South but for the Negro.

Arrangements are being made for 130 men, ambulances and other conveyances to be on hand and every possible attention will be given the troops.

## Pick Ups.
The busy season for Wilmington is beginning to open. The extremity many of our people were put to this summer ought to be an incentive for them to look out for the next.

Despise not the day of small beginnings. A blind man who picks up odds and ends and who buys and sells old bottles, owns his own home and has some money in the bank. Many of our salaried men have not done half so well.

## Good Words for Washington
**Improvement in Moral Tone of the Nation’s Capital**

Gen. H.V. Boynton, the veteran Washington correspondent, has been for more than 30 years collecting news and writing letters. Few men know so thoroughly as he the inside history of the capitol, the white house, and the departments. Being asked what he considered the most important deduction from his experience at Washington, he answered:

“The marvelous improvement in the moral atmosphere, and the general tone and honesty of the government. We, the people of the United States, have the most honest government in the world. It is and has been for many years more honest than ever before, and is to-day more honestly and efficiently administered that any private business that I have ever examined. I mean that there is less waste and less defalcation.

“Look at the great postal service, for instance. Where in the world will you find any private agency which does so much and does it so well and at so little cost? And change of parties makes no difference. Thorough honesty is the [illegible]

The atmosphere [illegible] house is pure beyond [illegible] residence, and this is the [illegible] moral and peaceable city in the United States, if not in the world. It makes me laugh when those good people come from New York and Cincinnati and away out west to help reform Washington.”

## Persecuted in America
**John Wesley Suffered for Refusing Communion to a Woman.**

Rev. W.J. Scott, D.D., writes of “When John Wesley Preached in Georgia,” in Ladies’ Home Journal, and from the famous preacher’s journal tells the story of his persecution in Georgia, which ultimately resulted in his quitting America and returning to England in 1737. During the afternoon before Wesley’s departure he was approached by the recorder of Savannah, who informed him that he must not leave the province until he had given bond in £50 sterling, and in addition furnished bail to answer Mr. Williamson’s charges. Wesley responded: ‘I have given him every opportunity to make good his accusation, but he refused to do so and now, sir,’ he continued, with emphasis and firmness, I must insist that [illegible] an official, you have treated me and the trustees of the colony very ill. I shall neither give bond nor bail. You know your business and I know [illegible].

“’The same afternoon[?],‘ he adds, ‘I shook the dust off my feet and left Savannah, after [illegible] there one year and nine months [illegible] I ought, but as I was able.’

“The show [illegible] his enemies of a purpose to [illegible] him was a shallow pretext [illegible] regarded.”

Wesley [illegible] the outcome of [illegible] a woman of his congregation[illegible] communion without evidence[illegible] [ ]ntance and contrition.

## Dangerous Caterpillars.
**Armed with a [illegible] Effective Weapon for Defense.**

The caterpillar of the puss moth, quite a common insect in this country, has a most effective way of defending himself, and may prove, as we shall presently see, dangerous even to human beings, says a writer in Chamber’s Journal. The well-protected caterpillar is provided between its head and forelegs with a cleft, from which it can protrude an organ capable of squirting out a quantity of very acid fluid to a considerable distance, and when alarmed it habitually makes use of this formidable weapon.

In one of the entomological magazines a correspondent states that he was observing some of these caterpillars in captivity, when he happened to disturb one, and it suddenly squirted out a quantity of fluid in a jet, which struck one of his eyeballs, though his head at the time was quite two feet away from the insect. He rushed off in great agony to a doctor, who told him that the eyeball was in a very dangerous condition. His eye was totally blind for hours after the occurrence, and it was some days before he finally recovered. What the effect of this fluid must be upon smaller creatures we leave our readers to imagine!

## German Settlement in Indiana.

Four towns in two counties in Indiana make up a German settlement where German customs prevail exclusively in the home habits of the people, although all the inhabitants speak English and [illegible] English as well as German. The towns are Ferdinand and St. Henry, in Dubois county, and St. Meinrad and Maria Hill, in Spencer county. Ferdinand, the oldest of the towns, was founded by a missionary priest, Father Kendrick, in 1840, and was named in the honor of Ferdinand I of Austria. There are no Americans in it, and there are only two families of Americans in St. Meinrad, which is the seat of a Benedictine monastery.

## Need for Haste.
A nervous young lady called a physician for a slight ailment, but one which she magnified, in her own estimation, into a serious one. “Run,” said the doctor to a servant, giving him a prescription, “to the nearest drug store and bring back the medicine as quickly as you can.” “Is there much danger?” replied the young lady, in alarm. “Yes,” said the doctor; “if your servant is not quick it will be useless.”  “Oh, doctor, shall I die?” gasped the patient. “There is no danger of that,” said the doctor. “But you may get well before John returns.”

## Insanity in Ireland.
Insanity is increasing in Ireland. English statisticians say that one serious cause of lunacy is the abuse of tea, another an overindulgence in alcohol, a third the disappointment of having tried emigration and failed.
