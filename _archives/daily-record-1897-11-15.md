## [Indecipherable]

A “stereoptico-musical aggregation” from San Antonio visited a neighboring Texas town. To entertain the inhabitants they impressed an old grand piano which had lain long unused in the public hall. The “professor” opened the lids and found that the keys responded pleasantly to his touch. He launched into Wagnerian melody, and the pianissimo prelude gently awakened a colony of wasps that had built a nest in a recess of the instrument during the months of its idleness. The pianist plunged into fortissimo and was startled to find the rumble and roar of his basso-profundo notes accompanied by a strange, high, angry hum. In another second, with a vicious whir of wings, the yellow jackets were out and upon professor, “aggregation,” and audience. There was a howling stampede for windows and doors; and in current history it is written that the San Antonio train, which was flagged at the crossing that night, carried away a little band of men who looked as if they had had an unvictorious encounter with a threshing machine.

## Passing of the Mustangs

**Wild horses are No Longer of any Value.**

The wild horse of Texas has become one of the greatest nuisances within the border of the Lone Star State. Not satisfied with its own freedom, the wild horse has adopted the tactics of the Apache and of the Sioux and stampedes its brethren. Novelists have taught us to believe that the wild mustang is emblematic of freedom, pure and noble. The Texas ranchman regards him as an emissary of the evil one, for he brings to his ranch despair and loss.

For the last decade the droves of horses that run in Texas have been steadily increasing in number and strength. Years ago it was worthwhile to catch these animals to sell.  Nowadays it is hard work to sell a mustang for use even as a cow pony.  Formerly it was the case that there was no horse for the stockman, the cattle-grower, like the Texas pony which had run wild for the four or five years of its life. Lean and sinewy as an Arab with the endurance of an Indian and a capacity for steady speed that can only be likened to a locomotive he was a treasure, Well seasoned, a cow pony could be ridden 100 miles in a single day and come out of the encounter with fatigue with flying colors.

The wild horse, however – that same animal which the 10-cent novelist describes as the “fiery untamed steed” – believes the sweets of freedom are so very sweet that all his brethren in bondage should share them. With this in mind therefore he swoops down upon the inclosure [sic] of the ranchman, induces the cow ponies to brave the terrors of jumping a barbwire fence and takes chances on clearing the sides of the corral. The result is that the stockman, unless one of the riders stops our guard, is likely to wake up in the morning and find his herd stampeded.

If it is the round-up the first thing the wranglers know a thunder of hoofs comes from the prairie, a shrill neighing, which the herd answers in equally shrill notes. The hoof beats sound nearer and nearer, the herd grows more and more excited and uneasy, until finally the wild mustangs dash in and mingle with the cow ponies and in a moment more all are off for some place but no one  knows where. The [wrath?]  [ ] herders [ ] .
