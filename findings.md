Third Person is foremost about documentary research -- doing it passionately, and using the results creatively. Our projects tend to result in a lot of documents and objects: old photographs and recordings, forgotten texts (newspapers and letters), postcards, and uncategorizable ephemera. This website gives us a place to store some of that material and share it with the public, i.e. you. We want ThirdPersonProject.org to serve in part as a kind of online gallery where you can browse through the things weâ€™ve found. It probably goes without saying that we welcome submissions!
