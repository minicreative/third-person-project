The discovery of Josh Halsey’s unmarked burial place has led to the organization of a group, made up of community elders and descendents of the Halsey family,which has come together to plan a monument for Halsey. It represents the only known burial location of an 1898 victim. The Rev. Dr. Barber of Raleigh eulogized Mr. Halsey, and descendants of Josh and Sallie Halsey attended the dedication services on Nov. 6, 2021.
